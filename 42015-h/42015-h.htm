<h1 title="">Helen in the Editor&rsquo;s Chair</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br /><i>The Weekly Herald</i></h2>
<p>Thursday!</p>
<p>Press day!</p>
<p>Helen Blair anxiously watched the clock on the
wall of the assembly room. Five more minutes
and school would be dismissed for the day. How
those minutes dragged. She moved her books
impatiently.</p>
<p>Finally the dismissal bell sounded. Helen
straightened the books in her desk and, with the
162 others in the large assembly of the Rolfe
High School, rose and marched down to the cloak
room. She was glad that school was over for, to
her, Thursday was the big day of the week.</p>
<p>Press day!</p>
<p>What magic lay in those two words.</p>
<p>By supper time the <i>Rolfe Herald</i> would be in
every home in town and, when families sat down
to their evening meal, they would have the paper
beside them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s father, Hugh Blair, was the editor and
publisher of the <i>Herald</i>. Her brother, Tom, a
junior in high school, wrote part of the news and
operated the Linotype, while Helen helped in the
office every night after school and on Saturdays.</p>
<p>On Thursday her work comprised folding the
papers as they came off the clanking press. Her
arms ached long before her task was done, but she
prided herself on the neatness of the stacks of
papers that grew as she worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to stay for the final sophomore
debate tryouts?&rdquo; asked Margaret Stevens.
Margaret, daughter of the only doctor in Rolfe,
lived across the street from the Blairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this afternoon,&rdquo; smiled Helen, &ldquo;this is
press day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten,&rdquo; laughed Margaret. &ldquo;All right,
hurry along and get your hands covered with ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over after supper and tell me about the
tryouts,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; promised Margaret as she turned to
the classroom where the tryouts were to be held.</p>
<p>The air was warm and Helen, with her spring
coat over her arm, hurried from the high school
building and started down the long hill that led
to the main street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Rolfe was a pretty midwestern village tucked
away among the hills bordering Lake Dubar, a
long, narrow body of water that attracted summer
visitors from hundreds of miles away.</p>
<p>The main street, built along a valley that opened
out on the lake shore, was a broad, graveled street,
flanked by a miscellaneous collection of stores and
shops. Some of them were of weather-beaten red
brick, others were of frame and a few of them,
harking back to pioneer days, had false fronts.
In the afternoon sun, it presented a quiet, friendly
scene.</p>
<p>Helen reached the foot of the school house hill
and turned on to the main street. On the right
of the street and just two blocks from the lake
shore stood the one-story frame structure housing
the postoffice and her father&rsquo;s printing plant. The
postoffice occupied the front half of the building
and the <i>Herald</i> office was the rear.</p>
<p>Helen walked down the alleyway between the
postoffice and the Temple furniture store. She
heard the noise of the press before she reached the
office and knew that her father had started the
afternoon run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>The <i>Herald</i>, an eight page paper, used four
pages of ready print and four pages of home print.
Each week&rsquo;s supply of paper was shipped from
Cranston, where four pages filled with prepared
news and pictures, were printed. The other four,
carrying local advertisements and news of Rolfe
and vicinity were printed on the aged press in the
<i>Herald</i> office.</p>
<p>Helen hurried up the three steps leading to the
editorial office. Its one unwashed window shut
out the sunlight, and the office lay in a semi-shadow.
Unable to see clearly after the brightness
of the sunlight, she did not see her father
at his desk when she entered the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Dad,&rdquo; she called as she took off her tam
and sailed it along the counter where it finally
came to rest against a stack of freshly printed
<i>Heralds</i>.</p>
<p>Her father did not answer and Helen was on
the point of going on into the composing room
when she turned toward him. His head still
rested on his arms and he gave no sign of having
heard her.</p>
<p>Concerned over his silence, she hurried to his
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, Dad!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter!
Answer me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Her father&rsquo;s head moved and he looked up at
her. His face was pale and there were dark
hollows under his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, Helen,&rdquo; he said, but the usual
smile was missing. &ldquo;Just felt a little faint and
came in here to take a few minutes rest. I&rsquo;ll be
all right shortly. You go on and help Tom. I&rsquo;ll
be with you in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t feel well, Dad, you&rsquo;d better
go home and rest,&rdquo; insisted Helen. &ldquo;You know
Tom and I can finish getting out the paper. Now
you run along and don&rsquo;t worry about things at the
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached for his hat and coat hanging on a
hook at one side of the desk. He remonstrated
at the prospect of going home with the work only
half done, but Helen was adamant and her father
finally gave in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it will be best,&rdquo; he agreed as he walked
slowly toward the door.</p>
<p>Helen watched him descend the steps; then saw
him reach the street and turn toward home.</p>
<p>She was startled by the expression she had just
seen on her father&rsquo;s face. He had never been
particularly robust and now he looked as though
something had come upon him which was crushing
his mind and body. Illness, worry and apprehension
had carved lines in his face that afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Helen went into the composing room where the
Linotype, the rows of type cases, the makeup
tables, the job press and the newspaper press were
located. At the back end of the room was the
large press, moving steadily back and forth as
Tom, perched on a high stool, fed sheets of paper
into one end. From the other came the freshly
printed papers of that week&rsquo;s edition of the
<i>Herald</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut off the press,&rdquo; called Helen, shouting to
make herself heard above the noise of the working
machinery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say?&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut it off,&rdquo; his sister replied.</p>
<p>Tom scowled as he reached for the clutch to
stop the press. He liked nothing better than running
the press and when he had it well under way,
usually printed the whole edition without a stop
unless the paper became clogged or he had to readjust
the ink rollers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying
to get through so I can play some baseball before
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s sick,&rdquo; explained Helen, &ldquo;and I made
him go home. Do you know what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, no,&rdquo; said Tom as he climbed down from
his stool. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t feeling very well when I
came down from school and said he was going in
the office to rest, but I didn&rsquo;t know he felt that
badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he did,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m worried
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always take him more or less for granted.
He goes on year after year working in the office,
getting enough together to make us all comfortable
and hoping that he can send us to college
some day. We help him when we can, but he plugs
away day after day and I&rsquo;ve noticed lately that
he hasn&rsquo;t been very perky. Mother has been
worried, too. I can tell from the way she acts
when Dad comes home at night. She&rsquo;s always
asking him how he feels and urging him to get
to bed early. I tell you, Tom, something&rsquo;s wrong
with Dad and we&rsquo;ve got to find out and help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go get Doctor Stevens right now,&rdquo; said
the impetuous Tom, and he reached to shut off the
motor of the press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;If Dad thought we
weren&rsquo;t getting the paper out on time he&rsquo;d worry
all the more. We&rsquo;ll finish the paper and then
have Doctor Stevens come over this evening. We
can fix it so he&rsquo;ll just drop in for a social call.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; said Tom as he climbed back on
his stool and threw in the clutch.</p>
<p>The press started its steady clanking and Helen
picked up a pile of papers and spread them out on
one of the makeup stones. Her father had
printed two of the pages of home news during the
morning and these sheets were stacked in a pile
in one corner. She arranged two piles of papers
on the makeup table, one pile which her father
had printed and one of papers which were coming
off the press as fast as Tom could keep it rolling.</p>
<p>Helen put on a heavy, blue-denim apron to protect
her school dress and went to work. With
nimble hands she put the sheets of paper together,
folded them with a quick motion and slid the completed
paper off the table and onto a box placed
close by for that purpose.</p>
<p>The press, of unknown vintage, moved slowly
and when Helen started at the same time as Tom
she could fold the papers as rapidly as they were
printed. But that day Tom, who had managed to
be excused half an hour early, had too much of
a start and when he finished the press run Helen
still had several hundred papers to fold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Tom stopped the press, shut off the motor,
raised the ink rollers and then pulled the forms off
the press and carried them to the other makeup
table. After washing the ink off the type with a
gasoline-soaked rag, he gathered an armful of
papers Helen had folded and carried them into the
editorial office. There he got out the long galleys
which held the names of the subscribers. He
inked each galley, placed it in the mailing machine,
and then fed the papers into the mailer. They
came out with the name of a subscriber printed at
the top of each paper.</p>
<p>The young Blairs worked silently, hastening
to complete their respective tasks so they could
hurry home. Tom had forgotten his plans to play
baseball and all thought of the outcome of the
debate tryouts had left Helen&rsquo;s mind. There was
one thought uppermost in their minds. What was
the matter with their father?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br /><i>Startling News</i></h2>
<p>The last paper folded, Helen removed the heavy
apron and washed her hands at the sink behind the
press. When she entered the editorial office Tom
was putting the last of the papers through the
mailer. They gathered them up, placed them in a
large sack and carried them into the postoffice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t stop to sweep out tonight,&rdquo; said
Helen. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s lock up and then see Doctor Stevens
on our way home. He&rsquo;s usually in his office at this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom agreed and, after putting away the mailing
machine, locked the back door, closed the windows
in the shop and announced that he was ready to go.</p>
<p>Helen locked the front door and they walked
down main street toward the white, one-story
building which housed the office of Doctor
Stevens, the town&rsquo;s only physician.</p>
<p>Tom was tall and slender with wavy, brown
hair and brown eyes that were always alive with
interest. Helen came scarcely above his shoulder,
but she was five feet two of concentrated energy.
She had left her tam at the office and the afternoon
sun touched her blond hair with gold. Her eyes
were the same clear blue as her mother&rsquo;s and the
rosy hue in her cheeks gave hint of her vitality.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>They entered Doctor Stevens&rsquo; waiting room and
found the genial physician reading a medical
journal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Helen! How are you Tom?&rdquo; He
boomed in his deep voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine, Doctor Stevens,&rdquo; replied Helen,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;re worried about Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with your father?&rdquo;
asked the doctor, adjusting his glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad wasn&rsquo;t feeling very well when I came
down from school at three-thirty,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;and
when I started the afternoon press run, he went
into the office to rest a while. When Helen came
in a little after four, Dad looked pretty rocky and
she made him go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he look when you talked with him?&rdquo;
Doctor Stevens asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awfully tired and mighty worried,&rdquo; replied
Helen. &ldquo;It was his eyes more than anything else.
He&rsquo;s afraid of something and it has worried him
until he is positively ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And haven&rsquo;t you any idea what it could be?&rdquo;
asked the doctor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it ever since Dad went
home,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know of a single
thing that would worry him that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;d like to have you do,&rdquo; went on
Helen, &ldquo;is to drop in after supper. Make it look
like a little social visit and it will give you a good
excuse to give Dad the once over. We&rsquo;ll be ever
so much relieved if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; the doctor assured them.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably worrying about some little thing
and the more you think about it, the larger it
grows. Possibly a little touch of stomach trouble.
What have you been trying to cook, lately?&rdquo; he
asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be my cooking,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t done any for a week and you know that
Mother&rsquo;s good cooking would never make anyone
ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come over about seven-thirty,&rdquo; promised
Doctor Stevens, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t you two worry yourselves
over this. Your father will be all right in
a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen and Tom thanked Doctor Stevens and
continued on their way home. They went back
past the postoffice and the <i>Herald</i> and down
toward the lake, whose waters reflected the rays of
the setting sun in varied hues.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>A block from the lake shore they turned to their
right into a tree-shaded street and climbed a gentle
hill. Their home stood on a knoll overlooking the
lake. It was an old-fashioned house that had
started out as a three room cottage. Additions
had been made until it rambled away in several
directions. It boasted no definite style of architecture,
but had a hominess that few houses possess.
From the long, open front porch, there was an unobstructed
view down the lake, which stretched
away in the distance, its far reaches hidden in the
coming twilight. A speed boat, being loaded with
the afternoon mail for the summer resorts down
the lake, was sputtering at the big pier at the foot
of main street. A bundle of <i>Heralds</i> was placed on
the boat and then it whisked away down the lake,
a curving streak of white marking its passage.</p>
<p>Helen found her mother in the kitchen preparing
their evening meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Mrs. Blair, at forty-five, was a handsome
woman. Her hair had decided touches of gray
but her face still held the peachbloom of youth and
she looked more like an older sister than a
mother. She had been a teacher in the high school
at Rolfe when Hugh Blair had come to edit the
country paper. The teacher and the editor had
fallen in love and she had given up teaching and
married him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Dad?&rdquo; Helen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t feel very well,&rdquo; her mother replied
and Helen could see lines of worry around her
mother&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Mother,&rdquo; she counselled. &ldquo;Dad
has been working too hard this year. In two more
weeks school will be over and Tom and I can do
most of the work on the paper. You two can plan
on a fine trip and a real rest this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blair, &ldquo;for your father
certainly needs a change of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen helped her mother with the preparations
for supper, setting the table and carrying the food
from the kitchen to the dining room where broad
windows opened out on the porch.</p>
<p>Tom, who had been upstairs washing the last
of the ink from his hands, entered the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supper about ready?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty
hungry tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; smiled his mother. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call your
father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Helen turned on the lights in the dining room
and they waited for their father to come from his
bedroom. They could hear low voices for several
minutes and finally Mrs. Blair returned to the
dining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go ahead and eat,&rdquo; she managed to smile.
&ldquo;Your father doesn&rsquo;t feel like supper right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom started to say something, but Helen shook
her head and they sat down and started their evening
meal.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair, usually gay and interested in the
activities of the day, had little to say, but Helen
talked of school and the activities and plans of the
sophomore class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a picnic down the lake
next Monday,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Tom, who was president
of the junior class. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re giving the seniors the
finest banquet they&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon they fell into a heated argument
over the merits of the sophomores and juniors,
a question which had been debated all year without
a definite decision. Sometimes Tom considered
himself the victor while on other occasions Helen
had the best of the argument.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Supper over, Helen helped her mother clear the
table and wash the dishes. It was seven-thirty
before they had finished their work in the kitchen
and Mrs. Blair was on her way to her husband&rsquo;s
room when Doctor Stevens, bag in hand, walked
in.</p>
<p>A neighbor for many years, the genial doctor
did not stop to knock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t been in for weeks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so
thought I&rsquo;d drop over and chin with Hugh for a
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh isn&rsquo;t feeling very well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blair.
&ldquo;He came home from the office this afternoon and
didn&rsquo;t want anything for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have a look at him,&rdquo; said Doctor
Stevens. &ldquo;Suppose his stomach is out of whack
or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Helen, standing in the dining room,
watched Doctor Stevens and their mother go down
the hall to their father&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
<p>The next half hour was one of the longest in
their young lives. Tom tried to read the continued
story in the <i>Herald</i>, while Helen fussed at first
one thing and then another.</p>
<p>The door of their father&rsquo;s room finally opened
and Doctor Stevens summoned them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Neither Tom nor Helen would ever forget the
scene in their father&rsquo;s bedroom that night. Their
mother, seated at the far side of the bed, looked at
them through tear-dimmed eyes.</p>
<p>Their father, reclining on the bed, looked taller
than ever, and the lines of pain which Helen had
noticed in his face that afternoon had deepened.
His hands were moving nervously and his eyes
were bright with fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Doctor Stevens as he took a
chair beside Hugh Blair&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<p>Tom was about to ask his father how he felt,
when Doctor Stevens spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well face this thing together,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you now that it is going to be
something of a fight for all of you, but unless I&rsquo;m
mistaken, the Blairs are all real fighters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter Doctor Stevens?&rdquo; Helen&rsquo;s
voice was low and strained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father must take a thorough rest,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;He will have to go to some southwestern
state for a number of months. Perhaps it will
only take six months, but it may be longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t be away that long,&rdquo; protested Hugh
Blair. &ldquo;I must think of my family, of the <i>Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your family must think of you now,&rdquo; said
Doctor Stevens firmly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I wanted to
talk this over with Tom and Helen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just what is wrong, Dad?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens answered the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lung trouble,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Your father
has spent too many years bent over his desk in that
dark cubbyhole of his&mdash;too many years without a
vacation. Now he&rsquo;s got to give that up and devote
a number of months to building up his body
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen felt the blood racing through her body.
Her throat went dry and her head ached. She
had realized only that afternoon that her father
wasn&rsquo;t well but she had not been prepared for
Doctor Stevens&rsquo; announcement.</p>
<p>The doctor was talking again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I blame myself partly,&rdquo; he was telling Hugh
Blair. &ldquo;You worked yourself into this almost
under my eyes, and I never dreamed what was
happening. Too close to you, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you think Hugh should start for the
southwest?&rdquo; asked Helen&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as we can arrange things,&rdquo; replied
Doctor Stevens. &ldquo;This is Thursday. I&rsquo;d like to
have him on the way by Saturday night. Every
day counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; protested Hugh Blair,
half rising from his bed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can
possibly afford it. Think of the expense of a trip
down there, of living there. What about the
<i>Herald</i>? What about my family?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>A plan had been forming in Helen&rsquo;s mind from
the time Doctor Stevens had said her father must
go to a different climate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything will be all right, Dad,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a reason in the world why you
shouldn&rsquo;t go. Tom and I are capable of running
the <i>Herald</i> and with what you&rsquo;ve saved toward
our college educations, you can make the trip and
stay as long as you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t think of using your college
money,&rdquo; protested her father, &ldquo;even if you and
Tom could run the <i>Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen&rsquo;s got the right idea,&rdquo; said Doctor
Stevens. &ldquo;Your health must come above everything
else right now. I&rsquo;m sure those youngsters
can run the <i>Herald</i>. Maybe they&rsquo;ll do an even
better job than you,&rdquo; he added with a twinkle in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can run the paper in fine shape, Dad,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;If you hired someone from outside to come
in and take charge it would eat up all the profits.
If Helen and I run the <i>Herald</i>, we&rsquo;ll have every
cent we make for you and mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair, who had been silent during the discussion,
spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Tom and Helen are right.
I know how you dislike using their college money,
but it is right that you should. I am sure that they
can manage the <i>Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it was arranged that Tom and Helen were
to take charge of the <i>Herald</i>. They talked with
the superintendent of schools the next day and he
agreed to excuse them from half their classes for
the remaining weeks of school with the provision
that they must pass all of their final examinations.</p>
<p>Friday and Saturday passed all too quickly.
Helen busied herself collecting the current accounts
and Tom spent part of the time at the office
doing job work and the remainder at home helping
with the packing.</p>
<p>Saturday noon Tom went to the bank and withdrew
the $1,275 their father had placed in their
college account. The only money left was $112
in the <i>Herald</i> account, just enough to take care of
running expenses of the paper.</p>
<p>Hugh Blair owned his home and his paper, was
proud of his family and his host of friends, but of
actual worldly wealth he had little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Doctor Stevens drove them to the Junction
thirty miles away where Hugh Blair was to take
the Southwestern limited. There was little conversation
during the drive.</p>
<p>The limited was at the junction when they arrived
and goodbyes were brief.</p>
<p>Hugh Blair said a few words to his wife, who
managed to smile through her tears. Then he
turned to Tom and Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take good care of the <i>Herald</i>,&rdquo; he told them,
as he gave them a goodbye hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will Dad and you take good care of yourself,&rdquo;
they called as he climbed into the Pullman.</p>
<p>Cries of &ldquo;boooo-ard,&rdquo; sounded along the train.
The porters swung their footstools up into the
vestibules, the whistle sounded two short, sharp
blasts, and the limited rolled away from the station.</p>
<p>Tom, Helen and their mother stood on the platform
until the train disappeared behind a hill.</p>
<p>When they turned toward home, Tom and
Helen faced the biggest responsibility of their
young lives. It was up to them to continue the
publication of the <i>Herald</i>, to supply the money to
keep their home going and to build up a reserve
which their father could call upon if he was forced
to use all the money from their college fund.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br /><i>In the Editor&rsquo;s Chair</i></h2>
<p>Sunday morning found Tom and Helen Blair
entering a new era in their lives. While their
father sped toward the southwest in quest of renewed
health, they planned how they could develop
the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<p>Their mother was silent through breakfast and
several times they saw her eyes dim with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Mother,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
manage all right and Dad is going to pull through
in fine shape. Why, he&rsquo;ll be back with us by
Christmas time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could be as optimistic as you are,
Helen,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better in a few more hours,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the suddenness of it all. Now we&rsquo;ve
got to buckle down and make the <i>Herald</i> keep on
paying dividends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Helen helped their mother clear away
the breakfast dishes and then dressed for Sunday
school. Mrs. Blair taught a class of ten-to-twelve-year-old
girls. Tom and Helen were in the
upper classes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>The Methodist church they attended was a red
brick structure, the first brick building built in
Rolfe, and it was covered with English ivy that
threatened even to hide the windows. The morning
was warm and restful and they enjoyed the
walk from home to church.</p>
<p>The minister was out of town on his vacation
and there were no church services. After Sunday
school the Blairs walked down to the postoffice.
The large mail box which was rented for the
<i>Herald</i> was filled with papers, circulars and letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well go back to the office and sort
this out,&rdquo; said Tom, and Mrs. Blair and Helen
agreed.</p>
<p>The office was just as Tom and Helen had left
it Thursday night for they had been too busy
since then helping with the arrangements for their
father&rsquo;s departure to clean it up.</p>
<p>The type was still in the forms, papers were
scattered on the floor and dust had gathered on
the counter and the desk which had served Hugh
Blair for so many years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open the windows and the back door,&rdquo;
said Tom, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll get some air moving through
here. It&rsquo;s pretty stuffy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Mrs. Blair sat down in the swivel chair in front
of her husband&rsquo;s desk and Helen pulled up the only
other chair in the office, an uncomfortable straight-backed
affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re editor now,&rdquo; Mrs. Blair told Helen.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better start in by sorting the mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s in charge,&rdquo; replied Helen as her brother
returned to the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not argue,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a
business meeting right now. Mother, you represent
Dad, who is the owner. Now you decide who
will be what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we need?&rdquo; smiled Mrs. Blair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a business manager first,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong,&rdquo; interjected Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a publisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I say let&rsquo;s make it unanimous and elect
mother as publisher,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the motion,&rdquo; grinned Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there are no objections, the motion is declared
passed,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;And now Mother,
you&rsquo;re the duly elected publisher of the <i>Rolfe
Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may turn out to be a hard-boiled boss,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Blair, but her smile belied her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not worrying a whole lot,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;The next business is selecting a business manager,
a mechanical department, an editor, and a reporter.
Also a couple of general handymen capable of doing
any kind of work on a weekly newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like a big payroll for a paper as
small as the <i>Herald</i>,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Blair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll be able to get them reasonable,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which case,&rdquo; added Helen, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better
appoint Tom as business manager, mechanical
department, and handyman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you might as well name Helen as editor,
reporter and first assistant to the handyman,&rdquo;
grinned Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve filled my positions easier than I expected,&rdquo;
smiled Mrs. Blair. &ldquo;As publisher, I&rsquo;ll stay at home
and keep out of your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, we don&rsquo;t want you to do that,&rdquo; exclaimed
Helen. &ldquo;We want you to come down and
help us whenever you have time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what could I do?&rdquo; asked her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of things. For instance, jot down all of
the personal items you know about your friends
and about all of the club meetings. That would
be a great help to me. Sometimes in the evening
maybe you&rsquo;d even find time to write them up, for
Tom and I are going to be frightfully busy between
going to school and running the <i>Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the town,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d handle
the society news, Mother, you could make it a great
feature. The <i>Herald</i> has never paid much attention
to the social events in town. Guess Dad was
too busy. But I think the women would appreciate
having all of their parties written up. I could set
up a nice head, &lsquo;Society News of Rolfe,&rsquo; and we&rsquo;d
run a column or so every week on one of the inside
pages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting me all excited, Tom,&rdquo; said his
mother. &ldquo;Your father said I never would make
a newspaper woman but if you and Helen will have
a little patience with me, I&rsquo;d really enjoy writing
the social items.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have patience with you, Mother?&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case of whether you&rsquo;ll have patience with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to plan our time carefully,&rdquo;
said Tom, &ldquo;for we&rsquo;ll have to keep up in our
school work. I&rsquo;ve got it doped out like this.
Superintendent Fowler says Helen and I can go
half days and as long as we cover all of the class
work, receive full credit. The first half of the
week is going to be the busiest for me. I&rsquo;ll have to
solicit my ads, set them up, do what job work I
have time for and set up the stories Helen turns
out for the paper. I could get in more time in the
afternoon than in the morning so Helen had better
plan on taking the mornings on Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday away from school.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will work out better for her, too,&rdquo; went on
Tom. &ldquo;Many of the big news events happen over
the week-end and she&rsquo;ll be on the job Monday
morning. I&rsquo;ll have every afternoon and evening
for my share of the work and for studying. Then
we&rsquo;ll both take Thursday afternoon away from
school and get the paper out. And on Friday,
Mother, if you&rsquo;ll come down and stay at the office,
we&rsquo;ll go to school all day. How does that sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me you&rsquo;ve thought of everything,&rdquo;
agreed Helen. &ldquo;I like the idea of doing my
editorial work in the mornings the first part of the
week and I&rsquo;ll be able to do some of it after school
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it looks like the <i>Herald</i> staff is about
ready to start work on the next issue,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;We have a publisher, a business manager and an
editor. What we need now are plenty of ads and
lots of news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you say, Mother, if Tom and I
stayed down at the office a while and did some
cleaning up?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Under the circumstances, I haven&rsquo;t any objections,&rdquo;
said their mother. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any church
service this morning and you certainly can put in
a few hours work here in the office to good advantage.
I&rsquo;ll stay and help you with the dusting and
sweeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You run on home and rest,&rdquo; insisted Helen.
&ldquo;Also, don&rsquo;t forget Sunday dinner. We&rsquo;ll be
home about two or two-thirty, and we&rsquo;ll be hungry
by that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair picked up the Sunday papers and
after warning Tom and Helen that dinner would
be ready promptly at two-thirty, left them in the
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Business Manager, what are you
going to start on?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Editor,&rdquo; replied Tom, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to throw
in all the type from last week&rsquo;s forms. What are
you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The office needs a good cleaning,&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put on my old apron and spend an
hour dusting and mopping. You keep out or
you&rsquo;ll track dirt in while I&rsquo;m doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Tom took off the coat of his Sunday suit, rolled
up his shirt sleeves and donned the ink-smeared
apron he wore when working in the composing
room. Helen put on the long apron she used when
folding papers and they went to work with their
enthusiasm at a high pitch. Their task was not
new but so much now depended on the success of
their efforts that they found added zest in everything
they did.</p>
<p>Helen went through the piles of old papers on
her father&rsquo;s desk, throwing many of them into the
large cardboard carton which served as a wastebasket.
When the desk was finally in order, she
turned her attention to the counter. Samples of
stationery needed to be placed in order and she
completely rearranged the old-fashioned show
case with its display of job printing which showed
what the <i>Herald</i> plant was capable of doing.</p>
<p>With the desk and counter in shape, Helen
picked up all of the papers on the floor, pulled the
now heavily laden cardboard carton into the composing
room, and then secured the mop and a pail
of water. The barber shop, located below the
postoffice, kept the building supplied with warm
water, and Helen soon had a good pail of suds.</p>
<p>Tom stopped his work in the composing room
and came in to watch the scrubbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First time that floor has been scrubbed in
years,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Helen as she swished her mop
into the corners. &ldquo;Dad was running the paper and
Mother was too busy bringing us up to come down
here and do it for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never recognize the old place when he
comes back,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll brighten it up a little,&rdquo; agreed Helen, as
Tom returned to his task of throwing in the type.</p>
<p>Helen had the editorial office thoroughly cleaned
by one o&rsquo;clock and sat down in her father&rsquo;s swivel
chair to rest. Tom called in from the back room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better plan your editorial work for the
week,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to run the Linotype every
afternoon and you&rsquo;ll have to have copy for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want first?&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get the editorials ready today,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have to be absolutely spot copy.
Dad wrote the first column himself and then
clipped a column or a column and a half from
nearby papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get at it right away,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;The
exchanges for last week are on the desk. After
I&rsquo;ve gone through them I&rsquo;ll write my own editorials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better have one about Dad going away,&rdquo; said
Tom and there was a queer catch in his voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Helen did not answer for her eyes filled with a
strange mist and her throat suddenly felt dry and
full.</p>
<p>Their father&rsquo;s departure for the southwest had
left a great void in their home life but Helen knew
they would have to make the best of it. She was
determined that their efforts on the <i>Herald</i> be
successful.</p>
<p>Helen turned to the stack of exchanges which
were on the desk and opened the editorial page of
the first one. She was a rapid reader and she scanned
paper after paper in quest of editorials which
would interest readers of the <i>Herald</i>. When she
found one she snipped it out with a handy pair of
scissors and pasted it on a sheet of copy paper.
Six or seven were needed for the <i>Herald&rsquo;s</i> editorial
page and it took her half an hour to get enough.
With the clipped editorials pasted and new heads
written on them, Helen turned to the typewriter to
write the editorials for the column which her
father was accustomed to fill with his own comments
on current subjects.</p>
<p>Helen had stacked the copypaper in a neat pile
on the desk and she took a sheet and rolled it into
the typewriter. She had taken a commercial
course the first semester and her mastery of the
touch system of typing was to stand her in good
stead for her work as editor of the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>For several minutes the young editor of the
<i>Herald</i> sat motionless in front of her typewriter,
struggling to find the right words. She knew her
father would want only a few simple sentences
about his enforced absence from his duties as publisher
of the paper.</p>
<p>Then Helen got the idea she wanted and her
fingers moved rapidly over the keys. The leading
editorial was finished in a short time. It was only
one paragraph and Helen took it out of the machine
and read it carefully.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hugh Blair, editor and publisher of
the <i>Herald</i> for the last twenty years, has been
compelled, by ill health, to leave his work at
Rolfe and go to a drier climate for at least six
months. In the meantime, we ask your cooperation
and help in our efforts to carry out
Mr. Blair&rsquo;s ideals in the publication of the
<i>Herald</i>.<span class="jr"> Signed,</span></p>
<p><span class="jr">Mrs. Hugh Blair, Helen and Tom Blair.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading the editorial carefully, Helen
called to her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in and see what you think of my lead
editorial,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Tom, his hands grimy with ink from the type he
had been throwing into the cases, came into the
editorial office.</p>
<p>He whistled in amazement at the change Helen
had brought about. The papers were gone from
the floor, which had been scrubbed clean, and the
desk and counter were neat and orderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a different office,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
wait until I have a chance to swing a broom and
mop in the composing room. And I&rsquo;m going to
fix some of the makeup tables so they&rsquo;ll be a little
handier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen handed him the editorial and Tom read
it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty short,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it tells the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad wouldn&rsquo;t want a long sob story,&rdquo; replied
Helen. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the clipped editorials. You
can put them on the hook on your Linotype and
I&rsquo;ll bring the others out as soon as I write
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom returned to the composing room with the
handful of editorial copy Helen had given him
and the editor of the <i>Herald</i> resumed her duties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>She wrote an editorial on the beauty of Rolfe
in the spring and another one on the desirability
for a paved road between Rolfe and Gladbrook,
the county seat. In advocating the paved road,
Helen pointed to the increased tourist traffic which
would be drawn to Rolfe as soon as a paved road
made Lake Dubar accessible to main highways.</p>
<p>It was nearly two o&rsquo;clock when she finished her
labor at the typewriter. She was tired and hungry.
One thing sure, being editor of the <i>Herald</i> would
be no easy task. Of that she was convinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home for dinner,&rdquo; she called to Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; replied her brother. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve finished
throwing in the last page. We&rsquo;re all ready to
start work on the next issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took off their aprons and while Helen
washed her hands, Tom closed the windows and
locked the back door. He took his turn at the sink
and they locked the front door and started for
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we need now is a good, big story for our
first edition,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may have it before nightfall if those clouds
get to rolling much more,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>Tom scanned the sky. The sunshine of the May
morning had vanished. Ominous banks of clouds
were rolling over the hills which flanked the
western valley of Lake Dubar and the lake itself
was lashed by white caps, spurred by a gusty
wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>They went down main street, turned off on the
side street and climbed the slope to their home.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair was busy putting some heavy pots
over flowers she wanted to protect from the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s all ready,&rdquo; she told them, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve
asked Margaret Stevens over. She wants to talk
with Helen about the sophomore class picnic tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have time to go,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
be awfully busy working on the next issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the class committee, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re going to the picnic. We&rsquo;ll have
lots to do on the <i>Herald</i> but we won&rsquo;t have to give
up all of our other activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom is right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blair. &ldquo;You must
plan on going to the picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margaret Stevens came across the street from
her home. Margaret was a decided brunette, a
striking contrast to Helen&rsquo;s blondness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go in and eat,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blair. &ldquo;Then
we&rsquo;ll come out and watch the storm. There is
going to be a lot of wind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Margaret was jolly and good company and
Helen thought her mother wise to have a guest for
dinner. It kept them from thinking too much
about their father&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>There was roast beef and hashed brown potatoes
with thick gravy, lettuce salad, pickled beets,
bread and butter, large glasses of rich milk and
lemon pie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never tasted a better meal,&rdquo; said Tom
between mouthfuls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve been so busy at the
office,&rdquo; smiled his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were moving right along,&rdquo; agreed Tom.
&ldquo;I got the forms all ready for the next issue and
Helen has the editorials done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you need a reporter?&rdquo; asked Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may need one but Helen and Mother are
going to try and do all the news writing,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean a reporter who would work for nothing.
I&rsquo;d like to help for I&rsquo;ve always wanted to write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could be a real help, Margaret,&rdquo; said
Helen, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;d enjoy having you help us. Keep
your ears open for all of the personal items and
tell Mother about any parties. She&rsquo;s going to
write the society news.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting quite a staff,&rdquo; smiled Tom.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m open for applications of anyone who wants
to work in the mechanical department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not as romantic as gathering and
writing news,&rdquo; said Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just as important,&rdquo; insisted Tom.</p>
<p>The room darkened and a particularly heavy
gust of wind shook the house. From the west
came a low rumbling.</p>
<p>Tom dropped his knife and fork and went to the
front porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Helen!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The storm&rsquo;s
breaking. You&rsquo;re going to have your first big
story right now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br /><i>Through the Storm</i></h2>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s cry brought the others from the dinner
table to the screened-in porch which overlooked
the lake. He was right. The storm was roaring
down out of the hills in the west in all its fury.</p>
<p>The black clouds which had been rolling along
the horizon when Tom and Helen had come home
were massed in a solid, angry front. Driven by a
whistling wind, they were sweeping down on the
lake. An ominous fringe of yellow wind clouds
dashed on ahead and as they reached the porch
they saw the waters of Lake Dubar whiten before
the fury of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a twister,&rdquo; shouted Tom.</p>
<p>His mother&rsquo;s face whitened and she anxiously
scanned the sky.</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens ran across from his home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better close all your windows and secure the
doors,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get a lot of
wind before the rain comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom is afraid of a tornado,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The weather is about right,&rdquo; admitted the
doctor. &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t worry until we see the
clouds start to swirl. Then we&rsquo;ll run for the storm
cellar under my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen and Margaret hurried to help Mrs. Blair
close the upstairs windows while Tom went around
to make sure that the screens were secure. He
bolted all doors except the one to the porch and
when he returned to join the others, the tempo of
the wind was increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>The wind suddenly dropped to a whisper and
Doctor Stevens watched the rolling clouds with
renewed anxiety. The waters of the lake were
calmer and the dust clouds which the wind had
driven over the water cleared partially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a motorboat
trying to reach one of the boathouses here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the haze of dust which still hung over
the lake they could discern the outline of a boat,
laboring to reach the safety of the Rolfe end of
the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jim Preston,&rdquo; said Doctor Stevens. &ldquo;He
goes down to the summer resorts at the far end of
the lake every Sunday morning with the mail and
papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His boat&rsquo;s got a lot of water in it from the way
it is riding,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;If the storm hits him
he&rsquo;ll never make it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jim should have known better than to have
taken a chance when he could see this mess of
weather brewing,&rdquo; snorted the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wife&rsquo;s sick,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Blair, &ldquo;and Jim&rsquo;s
probably taken an extra risk to get home as soon
as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Doctor Stevens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bailing by hand,&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;That
means something has gone wrong with the water
pump on the engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see what boat he has?&rdquo; asked Doctor
Stevens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like the Flyer,&rdquo; said Helen, who knew
the lines of every motorboat on the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the poorest wet weather boat Jim has,&rdquo;
said Doctor Stevens. &ldquo;Every white cap slops over
the side. She&rsquo;s fast but a death trap in a storm.
Either the Liberty or the Argosy would eat up
weather like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s been overhauling the engines in his other
boats,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;and the Flyer is the only thing
he has been using this spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of standing here talking, let&rsquo;s get down
to the shore,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Maybe we can get
someone to go out and help him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Without waiting for the others to reply, Helen
started running toward the lake. She heard a cry
behind her and turned to see Tom pointing toward
the hills in the west.</p>
<p>The wind was whistling again and when she
turned to look in the direction her brother pointed,
she stopped suddenly. The black storm clouds
were massing for the main attack and they were
rolling together.</p>
<p>In the seconds that Helen watched, she saw
them swirl toward a common center, heard the
deafening rise of the wind and trembled as the
clouds, now formed in a great funnel, started toward
the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back, Helen, come back!&rdquo; Tom shouted.</p>
<p>Forcing herself to overcome the storm terror
which now gripped her, Helen looked out over the
boiling waters of the lake.</p>
<p>The wind was whipping into a new frenzy and
she could just barely see the Flyer above the white-capped
waves. Jim Preston was making a brave
effort to reach shore and Helen knew that the little
group at her own home were probably the only
ones in Rolfe who knew of the boatman&rsquo;s danger.
Seconds counted and ignoring the warning cries
from her brother, she hurried on toward the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>The noise of the oncoming tornado beat on her
ears, but she dared not look toward the west. If
she did she knew she would turn and race for the
shelter and security of Doctor Stevens&rsquo; storm cellar.</p>
<p>The Flyer was rolling dangerously as Jim Preston
made for the shore and Helen doubted if the
boatman would ever make it.</p>
<p>On and on the sleek craft pushed its way, the
waves breaking over its slender, speedy nose and
cascading back into the open cockpit in which Jim
Preston was bailing furiously. The Flyer was
nosing deeper into the waves as it shipped more
water. When the ignition wires got wet the motor
would stop and Preston&rsquo;s last chance would be
gone.</p>
<p>Helen felt someone grab her arms. It was
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The tornado will be
on us in another five minutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to help Mr. Preston,&rdquo; shouted
Helen, and she refused to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then I stay too,&rdquo; yelled Tom, who
kept anxious eyes on the approaching tornado.</p>
<p>The Flyer was less than a hundred yards from
shore but was settling deeper and deeper into the
water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost shallow enough for him to wade
ashore,&rdquo; cried Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind would sweep him off his feet,&rdquo; replied
Tom.</p>
<p>The speedboat was making slow progress,
barely staggering along in its battle against the
wind and waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to make it!&rdquo; shouted Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Tom, but his words were lost
in the wind.</p>
<p>Fifty yards more and the Flyer would nose into
the sandy beach which marked the Rolfe end of the
lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Flyer, come on!&rdquo; cried Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The engine&rsquo;s dying,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Look, the
nose is going under that big wave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the motor dead, the Flyer lost way and
buried its nose under a giant white-cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s jumping out of the boat,&rdquo; added Helen.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s shallow enough so he can wade in if he can
keep his feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring the increasing danger of the tornado,
they ran across the sandy beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Join hands,&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;We can wade out
and pull him the last few feet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Realizing that his sister would go on alone if he
did not help her, Tom locked his hands in hers and
they plunged into the shallow water.</p>
<p>Jim Preston, on the verge of exhaustion, staggered
through the waves.</p>
<p>The Flyer, caught between two large rollers,
filled with water and disappeared less than ten
seconds after it had been abandoned.</p>
<p>The boatman floundered toward them and Tom
and Helen found themselves hard-pressed to keep
their own feet, for a strong undertow threatened
to upset them and sweep them out into the lake.</p>
<p>Preston lunged toward them and they caught
him as he fell.</p>
<p>Tom turned momentarily to watch the approach
of the tornado.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be able to reach
Doctor Stevens&rsquo; storm cellar if we run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t run,&rdquo; gasped Preston. &ldquo;You youngsters
get me to shore. Then save yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>With their encouragement, Preston made a new
effort and they made their escape from the
dangerous waters of the lake.</p>
<p>Alone, Helen or Tom could have raced up the
hill to Doctor Stevens in less than a minute but
with an almost helpless man to drag between them,
they made slow progress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to hurry,&rdquo; warned Tom as the noise
of the storm told of its rapid approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, go on! Leave me here!&rdquo; urged Preston.</p>
<p>But Helen and Tom were deaf to his pleas and
they forced him to use the last of his strength in a
desperate race up the hill ahead of the tornado.</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens met them half way up the hill
and almost carried Preston the rest of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Across the street and into my storm cellar,&rdquo;
he told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the tornado going to hit the town?&rdquo; asked
Helen as they hurried across the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell yet,&rdquo; replied Doctor Stevens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a common belief that the hills and lake
protect us so a tornado will never strike here,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know about that,&rdquo; said the doctor
grimly.</p>
<p>They got the exhausted boatman to the entrance
of the cellar, where Mrs. Blair was anxiously
awaiting their return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Helen?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little wet on my lower extremities,&rdquo; replied
the young editor of the <i>Herald</i>. &ldquo;I simply had to
go, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blair. &ldquo;It was
dangerous but I&rsquo;m proud of you Helen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Mrs. Stevens brought out blankets and wrapped
them around Jim Preston&rsquo;s shoulders while Margaret
took candles down into the storm cellar.</p>
<p>The noise of the storm had increased to such an
intensity that conversation was almost impossible.</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens maintained his watchful vigil,
noting every movement of the tornado.</p>
<p>The sky was so dark that the daylight had faded
into dusk although it was only a few minutes after
three. The whole western sky was filled with coal-black
clouds and out of the center of this ominous
mass rushed the lashing tongue which was
destroying everything it touched.</p>
<p>On and on came the storm, advancing with a
deadly relentlessness. A farm house a little more
than a mile away on one of the hills overlooking
the lake exploded as though a charge of dynamite
had been set off beneath it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible, terrible,&rdquo; sobbed Margaret
Stevens, who had come out of the cellar to watch
the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get hit,&rdquo; Tom warned them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get home,&rdquo; said Jim Preston, struggling
out of the blankets which Mrs. Stevens had
wrapped around him. &ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s all alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here, Jim,&rdquo; commanded Doctor Stevens.
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t get more than three or four blocks
before the storm strikes and your place is clear
across town. Everybody into the cellar,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stevens and Helen&rsquo;s mother went first to
light the candles. They were followed by Margaret
and Helen, then Tom and Jim Preston and finally
the doctor, who remained in the doorway on
guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will this do to the <i>Herald</i>?&rdquo; Helen whispered
to Tom.</p>
<p>Her brother nudged her hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Mother hear you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There
is nothing we can do now except hope. The
<i>Herald</i> building may not be destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen dropped to the floor and her head bowed
in prayer. Their father&rsquo;s illness had been a blow
and to have the <i>Herald</i> plant destroyed by a tornado
would be almost more than they could bear.</p>
<p>The noise of the tornado was terrific and they
felt the earth trembling at the fury of the storm
gods.</p>
<p>Helen had seen pictures of towns razed by tornadoes
but she had never dreamed that she would
be in one herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Suddenly the roar of the storm lessened and
Doctor Stevens cautiously opened the door of the
storm cellar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>They trooped out of the cellar. The tornado had
swung away from Rolfe without striking the town
itself and was lashing its way down the center of
Lake Dubar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will wear itself out before it reaches the end
of the lake,&rdquo; predicted Jim Preston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any houses in town were damaged,&rdquo;
said Doctor Stevens. &ldquo;A hen house and
garage or two may have been unroofed but that
will be about all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the farmers back in the hills?&rdquo;
asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have fared pretty badly if they were
in the center of the storm,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to get my car and start out that way. Someone
may need medical attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I go with you?&rdquo; asked Helen. &ldquo;I want to
get all the facts about the storm for my story for
the <i>Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to have you,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count me in,&rdquo; said Margaret Stevens. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
joined Helen&rsquo;s staff as her first reporter,&rdquo; she told
her father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to go down the lake in the morning
and see what happened at the far end I&rsquo;ll be
glad to take you,&rdquo; suggested Jim Preston. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
mighty grateful for what you and Tom did for
me and I&rsquo;ll have the Liberty ready to go by morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the Flyer?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to fish her out of the lake sometime
next week,&rdquo; grinned the boatman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lucky
even to be here, but I am, thanks to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens backed his sedan out of the
garage and Helen started toward the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go looking like that,&rdquo; protested her
mother. &ldquo;Your shoes and hose are wet and dirty
and your dress looks something like a mop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help the looks, mother,&rdquo; smiled Helen.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go as I am. This is my first big news
and the story comes first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br /><i>Reporting Plus</i></h2>
<p>Clouds which followed the terrific wind unleashed
their burden and a gray curtain of rain swept
down from the heavens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your slickers,&rdquo; Doctor Stevens called to
the girls and Helen raced across the street for her
coat and a storm hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better put on those heavy, high-topped boots
you use for hiking,&rdquo; Tom advised Helen when they
had reached the shelter of their own home. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
probably be gone the rest of the afternoon and
you&rsquo;ll need the boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen nodded her agreement and rummaged
through the down stairs closet for the sturdy
boots. She dragged them out and untangled the
laces. Then she kicked off her oxfords and started
to slide her feet into the boots. Her mother
stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put on these woolen stockings,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Those light silk ones will wear through in an hour
and your heels will be chafed raw.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>With heavy stockings and boots on, Helen
slipped into the slicker which Tom held for her.
She put on her old felt hat just as Doctor Stevens&rsquo;
car honked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye, Mother,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll
be all right with the doctor and Margaret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get all the news,&rdquo; cautioned Tom as Helen
ran through the storm and climbed into the
doctor&rsquo;s sedan.</p>
<p>Margaret Stevens was also wearing heavy shoes
and a slicker while the doctor had put on knee
length rubber boots and a heavy ulster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get plenty of rain before we&rsquo;re back,&rdquo;
he told the girls, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll have to walk where
the roads are impassable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stopped down town and Doctor Stevens
ran into his office to see if any calls had been left
for him. When he returned his face was grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I called the telephone office,&rdquo; replied her
father, &ldquo;and they said all the phone wires west
of the lake were down but that reports were a
number of farm houses had been destroyed by the
tornado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think someone may have been hurt?&rdquo;
asked Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; admitted Doctor Stevens as he
shifted gears and the sedan leaped ahead through
the storm. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to trust to luck that we&rsquo;ll
reach farms where the worst damage occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind was still of nearly gale force and the
blasts of rain which swept the graveled highway
rocked the sedan. There was little conversation
as they left Rolfe and headed into the hill
country which marked the western valley of Lake
Dubar.</p>
<p>The road wound through the hills and Doctor
Stevens, unable to see more than fifty feet ahead,
drove cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a close watch on each side,&rdquo; he told the
girls, &ldquo;and when you see any signs of unusual
damage let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were nearly three miles from Rolfe when
Margaret told her father to stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lane to our right that is blocked with
fallen tree trunks,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens peered through the rain. A mail
box leered up at them from a twisted post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Herb Lauer&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
out and go up the lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor picked up his medical case and left
the motor running so the heat it generated would
keep ignition wires dry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>One window was left open to guard against the
car filling with gas and the girls followed him into
the storm. They picked their way slowly over the
fallen trees which choked the lane. When they
finally reached the farmyard a desolate scene
greeted them.</p>
<p>The tornado, like a playful giant, had picked up
the one story frame house and dashed it against
the barn. Both buildings had splintered in a thousand
pieces and only a huddled mass of wreckage
remained. Miraculously, the corn crib had been
left almost unharmed and inside the crib they could
see someone moving.</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens shouted and a few seconds later
there came an answering cry. The girls followed
him to the crib and found the family of Herb
Lauer sheltered there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone hurt?&rdquo; asked Doctor Stevens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herb&rsquo;s injured his arm,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lauer, who
was holding their two young children close to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it&rsquo;s broken, Doc,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken is right,&rdquo; said Doctor Stevens as he
examined the injury. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix up a temporary
splint and in the morning you can come down and
have it redressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor worked quickly and when he was
ready to put on the splint had Margaret and Helen
help him. In twenty minutes the arm had been
dressed and put in a sling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send help out as soon as we can,&rdquo; said
Doctor Stevens as they turned to go.</p>
<p>Helen had used the time to good advantage,
making a survey of the damage done to the farm
buildings and learning that they were fully protected
by insurance. Mrs. Lauer, between attempts
to quiet the crying of the children, had
given Helen an eye-witness account of the storm
and how they had taken refuge in the corn crib
just before the house was swirled from its foundations.</p>
<p>Back in the car, the trio continued their relief
trip. The rain abated and a little after four
o&rsquo;clock the sun broke through the clouds. Ditches
along the road ran bankful with water and
streams they crossed tore at the embankments
which confined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst is over,&rdquo; said Doctor Stevens, &ldquo;and
we can be mighty thankful no one has been killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later they reached another
farm which had felt the effects of the storm. The
house had been unroofed but the family had taken
refuge in the storm cellar. No one had been injured,
except for a few bruises and minor
scratches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>At dusk they were fifteen miles west of Rolfe
and had failed to find anyone with serious injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve about reached the limit of the storm
area,&rdquo; said Doctor Stevens. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn now and
start back for Rolfe on the Windham road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their route back led them over a winding
road and before they left the main graveled highway
Doctor Stevens put chains on his car. They
ploughed into the mud, which sloshed up on the
sides of the machine and splattered against the
windshield until they had to stop and clean the
glass.</p>
<p>Half way back to Rolfe they were stopped by a
lantern waving in the road.</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens leaned out the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>A farmer stepped out of the night into the rays
of the lights of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need help,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The storm destroyed
our house and one of my boys was pretty badly
hurt. We&rsquo;ve got to get him to a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Doctor Stevens of Rolfe,&rdquo; said Margaret&rsquo;s
father as he picked up his case and opened the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need you doctor,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
<p>Helen and Margaret followed them down the
road and into a grassy lane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Lights were flickering ahead and when they
reached a cattle shed they found a wood fire burning.
Around the blaze were the members of the
farmer&rsquo;s family and at one side of the fire was the
blanket-swathed form of a boy of ten or eleven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the timbers from the house struck him
while he was running for the storm cave,&rdquo; explained
the farmer. &ldquo;He just crumpled up and
hasn&rsquo;t spoken to us since. It&rsquo;s as though he was
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens examined the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got a pretty nasty rap on the head,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;What he needs is a good bed, some warm
clothes and hot food. We&rsquo;ll put him in my car and
take him back to Rolfe. He&rsquo;ll be all right in two
or three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor looked about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Rigg Jensen place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Rigg Jensen,&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;You
fixed me up about ten years ago when my shotgun
went off and took off one of my little toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that,&rdquo; said Doctor Stevens.
&ldquo;Now, if you&rsquo;ll help me carry the lad, we&rsquo;ll get him
down to the car.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better go?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Jensen.
&ldquo;Eddie may be scared if he wakes up and sees only
strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; said Doctor Stevens, as they
picked up the boy and started for the car.</p>
<p>Helen went ahead, carrying the lantern and
lighting the way for the men. They made the boy
comfortable in the back seat and his mother got in
beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better come along,&rdquo; Doctor Stevens told the
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not tonight,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Mother is with
Eddie and I know he&rsquo;ll be all right now. I&rsquo;ve got
to take the lantern and see what happened to the
livestock and what we&rsquo;ve got left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no complaint in his voice, only a
matter-of-factness which indicated that the storm
could not have been prevented and now that it was
all over he was going to make the best of it.</p>
<p>Half an hour later they reached the gravel highway
and sped into Rolfe. Doctor Stevens drove
directly to his office and several men on the street
helped him carry Eddie Jensen inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better run along home,&rdquo; he told the
girls, &ldquo;and get something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Helen reached home, Tom was waiting
on the porch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get a story?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The young editor of the <i>Herald</i> nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone hurt?&rdquo; Tom insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one seriously injured,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;but
a lot of farm buildings were destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been checking up on the damage down the
lake,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that new summer resort on the
east shore got the worst of it. The phone office
finally got through and they estimate the damage
at the resort at about $50,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Stevens believes the damage along the
west half of the valley will amount to almost a
$100,000,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a real story,&rdquo; enthused Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s big
enough to telephone to the state bureau of the
Associated Press at Cranston. They&rsquo;ll be glad
to pay us for sending it to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You telephone,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be scared to
death and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to give them all the
facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the editor,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your
story and you ought to do the phoning. Jot down
some notes while I get a connection to Cranston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom went into the house to put in the long
distance call just as Helen&rsquo;s mother hurried across
from the Stevens home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, dear?&rdquo; her mother asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even wet,&rdquo; replied Helen. &ldquo;The coat and
boots protected me even in the heaviest rain.
Tom&rsquo;s just gone inside to call the Associated Press
at Cranston and I&rsquo;m going to tell them about the
storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up there,&rdquo; came Tom&rsquo;s voice from inside
the house. &ldquo;The Cranston operator has just
answered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I haven&rsquo;t had time to think what I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo;
added Helen, half to herself.</p>
<p>Without stopping to take off her cumbersome
raincoat, she hurried to the telephone stand in the
dining room and Tom turned the instrument over
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Helen picked up the telephone and heard a voice
at the other end of the wire saying, &ldquo;This is the
state bureau of the Associated Press at Cranston.
Who&rsquo;s calling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mustering up her courage, Helen replied, &ldquo;this
is Helen Blair, editor of the <i>Rolfe Herald</i>. We&rsquo;ve
had a tornado near here this afternoon and I
thought you&rsquo;d want the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to have them,&rdquo; came the peppy voice back
over the wire. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Helen forgot her early misgivings and briefly
and concisely told her story about the storm, giving
estimates of damage and the names of the
injured. In three minutes she was through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine story,&rdquo; said the Associated Press man at
Cranston. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll mail you a check the first of
the month. And say, you&rsquo;d better write to us.
We can use a live, wide-awake correspondent in
your town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I will,&rdquo; replied Helen as she hung up
the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me to write them; that they could use a
correspondent at Rolfe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom. &ldquo;One more
way in which we can increase our income and it
means that some day you may be able to get a job
with the Associated Press.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will have to come later,&rdquo; said Helen&rsquo;s
mother, &ldquo;when school days are over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;but creating a good
impression won&rsquo;t hurt anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair had a hot supper waiting, hamburger
cakes, baking powder biscuits with honey, and tea,
and they all sat down to the table for a belated
evening meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Helen related the events of her trip with Doctor
Stevens and Tom grew enthusiastic again over
the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the biggest news the <i>Herald</i> has had in
years. If we were putting out a daily we&rsquo;d be
working on an extra now. Maybe the <i>Herald</i> will
be a daily some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rolfe will have to grow a lot,&rdquo; smiled his
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; agreed Tom.</p>
<p>Tom and Helen helped their mother clear away
the supper dishes and after that Helen went into
the front room and cleared the Sunday papers off
the library table. She found some copypaper and
a pencil in the drawer and sat down to work on her
story of the storm.</p>
<p>The excitement of the storm and the ensuing
events had carried her along, oblivious of the
fatigue which had increased with the passing
hours. But when she picked up her pencil and
tried to write, her eyes dimmed and her head nodded.
She snuggled her head in her arms to rest
for just a minute, she told herself. The next
thing she knew Tom was shaking her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and time for all editors
to be in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Helen tried to rub the sleep from her eyes and
Tom laughed uproariously at her efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all tired out.
You can write your story in the morning. To bed
you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I been asleep all evening?&rdquo; Helen asked
her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and I think Tom&rsquo;s
right. Run along to bed and you&rsquo;ll feel more like
working on your story in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goodnights were said and Helen, only half
awake, went to her room, thus ending the most
exciting day in her young life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br /><i>A New Week Dawns</i></h2>
<p>Monday morning dawned clear and bright. There
were no traces in the sky of the storm which on
the previous day had devastated so many farms
west of Rolfe. The air was warm with a fragrance
and sweetness that only a small town
knows in springtime.</p>
<p>Helen exchanged greetings with half a dozen
people as she hurried down the street to start her
first day at the office as editor of the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<p>Grant Hughes, the postmaster, was busy sweeping
out his office but he stopped his work and called
to Helen as she turned down the alley-way which
led to the <i>Herald</i> office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starting in bright and early, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to,&rdquo; smiled Helen, &ldquo;for Tom and I have
only half days in which to put out the paper and
do the job work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; mused the old postmaster,
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;re chips off the old block. You&rsquo;ll make
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mr. Hughes,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Your believing
in us is going to help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>She hastened on the few steps to the office and
opened the doors and windows for the rooms were
close and stuffy after being closed overnight. The
young editor of the <i>Herald</i> paused to look around
the composing room. Tom had certainly done a
good job cleaning up the day before. The four
steel forms which would hold the type for the
week&rsquo;s edition were in place, ready for the news
she would write and the ads which it would be
Tom&rsquo;s work to solicit. The Linotype seemed to be
watching her in a very superior but friendly manner
and even the old press was polished and
cleaned as never before.</p>
<p>Helen returned to the editorial office, rolled a
sheet of copypaper into her typewriter, and sat
down to write the story of the storm. She might
have to change certain parts of the story about the
condition of the injured later in the week but she
could get the main part of it written while it was
still fresh in her memory.</p>
<p>Hugh Blair had always made a point of writing
his news stories in simple English and he had
drilled Helen and Tom in his belief that the simpler
a story is written the more widely it will be read.
He had no time for the multitudes of adjectives
which many country editors insist upon using, although
he felt that strong, colorful words had
their place in news stories.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>With her father&rsquo;s beliefs on news writing almost
second nature, Helen started her story. It
was simple and dramatic, as dramatic as the sudden
descent of the storm on the valley. Her fingers
moved rapidly over the keyboard and the story
seemed to write itself. She finished one page and
rolled another into the machine, hardly pausing in
her rapid typing.</p>
<p>Page after page she wrote until she finally
leaned back in her swivel chair, tired from the
strain of her steady work.</p>
<p>She picked up the half dozen pages of typed
copy. This was her first big story and she wanted
it to read well, to be something of which her father
would be proud when he read the copy of the paper
they would send him. She went over the story
carefully, changing a word here, another there.
Occasionally she operated on some of her sentences,
paring down the longer ones and speeding
up the tempo of the story. It was nine-thirty before
she was satisfied that she had done the best
she could and she stuck the story on the copy
spindle, ready for Tom when he wanted to translate
it into type on the Linotype.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Helen slid another sheet of copypaper into her
typewriter and headed it &ldquo;PERSONALS.&rdquo;
Farther down the page she wrote four items about
out-of-town people who were visiting in Rolfe.
She had just finished her personals when she heard
the whistle of the morning train.</p>
<p>The nine forty-five in the morning and the
seven-fifteen in the evening were the only trains
through Rolfe on the branch line of the A. and T.
railroad. The nine forty-five was the upbound
train to Cranston, the state capital. It reached
Cranston about one o&rsquo;clock, turned around there
and started back a little after three, passing
through Rolfe on its down trip early in the evening,
its over-night terminal being Gladbrook, the
county seat.</p>
<p>Helen picked up a pencil and pad of paper,
snapped the lock on the front door and ran for
the depot two blocks away. The daily trains were
always good for a few personals. She meant to
leave the office earlier but had lost track of the
time, so intense had been her interest in writing
her story of the storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>The nine forty-five was still half a mile below
town and puffing up the grade to the station when
Helen reached the platform. She spoke to the
agent and the express man and hurried into the
waiting room. Two women she recognized were
picking up their suit cases when she entered.
Helen explained her mission and they told her
where they were going. She jotted down the notes
quickly for the train was rumbling into town.
The local ground to a stop and Helen went to the
platform to see if anyone had arrived from the
county seat.</p>
<p>One passenger descended, a tall, austere-looking
man whose appearance was not in the least inviting
but Helen wanted every news item she could
get so she approached him, with some misgiving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the editor for the <i>Rolfe Herald</i>,&rdquo; she explained,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;d like to have an item about your
visit here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re what?&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the editor of the local paper,&rdquo; repeated
Helen, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d like a story about your visit in
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty young for an editor,&rdquo; persisted
the stranger, with a smile that decidedly changed
his appearance and made him look much less formidable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m substituting for my father,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That quite explains things,&rdquo; agreed the
stranger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Charles King of Cranston, state
superintendent of schools, and I&rsquo;m making a few
inspections around the state. If you&rsquo;d like, I&rsquo;ll see
you again before I leave and tell you what I think
of your school system here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll thoroughly approve,&rdquo; said
Helen. &ldquo;Mr. Fowler, the superintendent, is very
progressive and has fine discipline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him he has a good booster in the editor,&rdquo;
smiled Mr. King. &ldquo;Now, if you&rsquo;ll be good enough
to direct me to the school I&rsquo;ll see that you get a
good story out of my visit here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen supplied the necessary directions and the
state superintendent left the depot.</p>
<p>The nine forty-five, with its combination mail
and baggage car and two day coaches, whistled
out and Helen returned to the <i>Herald</i> office.</p>
<p>She found a farmer from the east side of the
valley waiting for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get some sale bills printed,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll need about five hundred quarter page
bills. How much will they cost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen opened the booklet with job prices listed
and gave the farmer a quotation on the job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds fair enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At least it&rsquo;s a
dollar less than last year.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Paper doesn&rsquo;t cost quite as much,&rdquo; explained
Helen, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re passing the saving on to you.
Be sure and tell your neighbors about our reasonable
printing prices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; promised the farmer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring
in the copy Tuesday and get the bills Friday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother will have them ready for you,&rdquo;
said Helen, &ldquo;but if you want to get the most out
of your sale, why not run your bill as an ad in
the <i>Herald</i>. On a combination like that we can
give you a special price. You can have a quarter
page ad in the paper plus 500 bills at only a little
more than the cost of the ad in the paper. It&rsquo;s the
cost of setting up the ad that counts for once it is
set up we can run off the bills at very little extra
cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much circulation do you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight hundred and seventy-five,&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;Three hundred papers go in town and the rest
out on the country routes.&rdquo; She consulted her
price book and quoted the price for the combination
ad and bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; agreed the farmer, who appeared
to be a keen business man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d work
out some kind of a tieup with the farm bureau at
Gladbrook and carry a page with special farm
news you could get a lot of advertising from
farmers. If you do, don&rsquo;t use &lsquo;canned&rsquo; news sent
out by agricultural schools. Get the county agent
to write a column a week and then get the rest of
it from farmers around here. Have items about
what they are doing, how many hogs they are feeding,
how much they get for their cattle, when they
market them and news of their club activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a fine idea,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll
have to go a little slowly at first. My brother and
I are trying to run the paper while Dad is away
recovering his health and until we get everything
going smoothly we can&rsquo;t attempt very many new
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep it in mind,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;for I
tell you, we people on the farms like to see news
about ourselves in the paper and it would mean
more business for you. Well, I&rsquo;ve got to be going.
I&rsquo;ll bring my copy in tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be expecting it,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Thanks
for the business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>She went around to the postoffice and returned
with a handful of letters. Most of them were circulars
but one of them was a card from her father.
She read it with such eagerness that her hands
trembled. It had been written while the train was
speeding through southwestern Kansas and her
father said that he was not as tired from the train
trip as he had expected. By the time they received
the card, he added, he would be at Rubio, Arizona,
where he was to make his home until he was well
enough to return to the more rigorous climate of
the north.</p>
<p>Helen telephoned her mother at once and read
the message on the card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to write to Dad and tell him all about
the storm and how happy we are that everything
is going well for him,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write this afternoon,&rdquo; said her mother,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll put the letters in one envelope and get
them off on the evening mail. Perhaps Tom will
find time to add a note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen sat down at the desk, found several sheets
of office stationery and a pen, and started her letter
to her father. She was half way through when
Jim Preston entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Miss Blair,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got the <i>Liberty</i> ready to go if you&rsquo;d like to run
down the lake and see how much damage the
twister caused at the summer resorts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you right
away.&rdquo; She put her letter aside and closed the office.
Five minutes later they were at the main pier
on the lakeshore.</p>
<p>The <i>Liberty</i>, a sturdy, 28-foot cruiser, was
moored to the pier. The light oak hood covering
the engine shone brightly in the morning sun and
Helen could see that Jim Preston had waxed it
recently. The hood extended for about fourteen
feet back from the bow of the boat, completely enclosing
the 60 horsepower engine which drove the
craft. The steering wheel and ignition switches
were mounted on a dash and behind this were four
benches with leather covered cork cushions which
could be used as life preservers.</p>
<p>The boatman stepped into the <i>Liberty</i> and
pressed the starter. There was the whirr of gears
and the muffled explosions from the underwater
exhaust as the engine started. The <i>Liberty</i> quivered
at its moorings, anxious to be away and
cutting through the tiny whitecaps which danced
in the sunshine.</p>
<p>Helen bent down and loosened the half hitches
on the ropes which held the boat. Jim Preston
steadied it while she stepped in and took her place
on the front seat beside him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>The boatman shoved the clutch ahead, the tone
of the motor deepened and they moved slowly
away from the pier. With quickening pace, they
sped out into the lake, slapping through the white
caps faster and faster until tiny flashes of spray
stung Helen&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it take us to reach Crescent
Beach?&rdquo; asked Helen for she knew the boatman
made his first stop at the new resort at the far end
of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nine miles,&rdquo; replied Jim Preston. &ldquo;If I
open her up we&rsquo;ll be down there in fifteen or sixteen
minutes. Want to make time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;but I enjoy
a fast ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes,&rdquo; smiled Preston and he shoved the
throttle forward.</p>
<p>The powerful motor responded to the increased
fuel and the <i>Liberty</i> shook herself and leaped
ahead, cutting a v-shaped swath down the center
of the lake. Solid sheets of spray flew out on each
side of the boat and Preston put up spray boards
to keep them from being drenched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Helen turned around and looked back at Rolfe,
nestling serenely along the north end of the lake.
It was a quiet, restful scene, the white houses
showing through the verdant green of the new
leaves. She could see her own home and thought
she glimpsed her mother working in the garden at
the rear.</p>
<p>Then the picture faded as they sped down the
lake and Helen gave herself up to complete enjoyment
of the boat trip.</p>
<p>There were few signs along the shore of the
storm. After veering away from Rolfe it had
evidently gone directly down the lake until it
reached the summer resorts.</p>
<p>In less than ten minutes Rolfe had disappeared
and the far end of the lake was in view. Preston
slowed the <i>Liberty</i> somewhat and swung across
the lake to the left toward Crescent Beach, the
new resort which several wealthy men from the
state capital were promoting.</p>
<p>They slid around a rocky promontory and into
view of the resort. Boathouses dipped crazily into
the water and the large bath-house, the most
modern on the lake, had been crushed while the
toboggan slide had been flipped upside down by the
capricious wind.</p>
<p>The big pier had collapsed and Preston nosed
the <i>Liberty</i> carefully in-shore until the bow grated
on the fresh, clean sand of the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Kirk Foster, the young manager of the resort,
was directing a crew of men who were cleaning up
the debris.</p>
<p>The boatman introduced Helen to the manager
and he willingly gave her all the details about the
damage. The large, new hotel had escaped unharmed
and the private cottages, some of which
were nicer than the homes in Rolfe, had suffered
only minor damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The damage to the bathhouse, about $35,000,
was the heaviest,&rdquo; said the manager, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t
forget to say in your story that we&rsquo;ll have things
fixed up in about two weeks, and everything is
insured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; promised Helen, &ldquo;and when you have
any news be sure and let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cater to a pretty ritzy crowd,&rdquo; replied the
manager, &ldquo;and we ought to have some famous
people here during the summer. I&rsquo;ll tip you off
whenever I think there is a likely story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim Preston left the mail for the resort and they
returned to the Liberty, backed out carefully, and
headed across the lake for Sandy Point, a resort
which had been on the lake for more years than
Helen could remember.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Sandy Point was popular with the townspeople
and farmers and was known for its wonderful
bathing beach. Lake Dubar was shallow there
and it was safe for almost anyone to enjoy the
bathing at Sandy Point.</p>
<p>The old resort was not nearly as pretentious as
Crescent Beach for its bathhouses, cottages and
hotel were weather beaten and vine-covered. Art
Provost, the manager, was waiting for the morning
mail when the Liberty churned up to the pier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Storm missed you,&rdquo; said the boatman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And right glad I am that it did,&rdquo; replied Provost.
&ldquo;I thought we were goners when I saw it
coming down the lake but it swung over east and
took its spite out on Crescent Beach. Been over
there yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stopped on the way down,&rdquo; replied Jim Preston.
&ldquo;They suffered a good bit of damage but will
have it cleaned up in a couple or three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear that,&rdquo; said Provost, &ldquo;that young
manager, Foster, is a fine fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen inquired for news about the resort and
was told that it would be another week, about the
first of June, before the season would be under
way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>They left Sandy Point and headed up the lake,
this time at a leisurely twenty miles an hour.
Helen enjoyed every minute of the trip, drinking
in the quiet beauty of the lake, its peaceful hills and
the charm of the farms with their cattle browsing
contentedly in the pastures.</p>
<p>It was noon when they docked at Rolfe and
Helen, after thanking the boatman, went home instead
of returning to the office.</p>
<p>Tom had come from school and lunch was on
the table. Helen told her brother of the sale of the
quarter page ad for the paper and the 500 bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;but you must have
looked on the wrong page in the cost book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I ask enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were short about fifty cents,&rdquo; grinned
Tom, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll make a profit on the job, especially
since you got him to run it as an ad in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do this afternoon?&rdquo;
Mrs. Blair asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the rounds of the stores and see what
business I can line up for the paper,&rdquo; said the business
manager of the <i>Herald</i>. &ldquo;Then there are a
couple of jobs of letterheads I&rsquo;ll have to get out of
the way and by the time I get them printed the
metal in the Linotype will be hot and I can set up
Helen&rsquo;s editorials and whatever other copy she got
ready this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The storm story runs six pages,&rdquo; said Helen,
&ldquo;and when I add a few paragraphs about the summer
resorts, it will take another page. Is it too
long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if it is well written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to judge that for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I walked home with Marg Stevens,&rdquo; said Tom,
&ldquo;and she said to tell you the sophomore picnic
planned for this afternoon has been postponed
until Friday. A lot of the boys from the country
have to go home early and help clean up the storm
damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me just as well,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;for we&rsquo;ll
have the paper off the press Thursday and I&rsquo;ll be
ready for a picnic Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom went to the office after lunch and Helen
walked to school with Margaret. Just before the
assembly was called to order, one of the teachers
came down to Helen&rsquo;s desk and told her she was
wanted in the superintendent&rsquo;s office. When Helen
reached the office she found Superintendent
Fowler and Mr. King, the state superintendent of
schools, waiting for her. The state superintendent
greeted her cordially and told Superintendent
Fowler how Helen had met him at the train.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I promised to give her a story about my visit,&rdquo;
he explained, &ldquo;and I thought this would be a good
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Superintendent Fowler nodded his agreement
and the state school leader continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll consider it good news,&rdquo; he told
Helen, &ldquo;when I say that the Rolfe school has been
judged the finest in the state for towns under one
thousand inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is news,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Mr.
Fowler has worked hard in the two years he has
been here and the <i>Herald</i> will be glad to have this
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would,&rdquo; said Mr. King, and he
told Helen in detail of the improvement which had
been made in the local school in the last two years
and how much attention it was attracting throughout
the state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really ought to have a school page in the
local paper,&rdquo; he told Helen in concluding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we will next fall,&rdquo; replied the young
editor of the <i>Herald</i>. &ldquo;By that time Tom and I
should be veterans in the newspaper game and
able to add another page of news to the <i>Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over next August when I come
back to get things in shape for the opening of the
fall term,&rdquo; said Superintendent Fowler. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
heartily in favor of one if Tom and Helen can
spare the time and the space it will require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen returned to the assembly with the handful
of notes she had jotted down while Mr. King
talked. Her American History class had gone to
its classroom and she picked up her textbook and
walked down the assembly, inquiring eyes following
her, wondering why she had been called into
the superintendent&rsquo;s office. They&rsquo;d have to read
the <i>Herald</i> to find out that story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br /><i>The First Issue</i></h2>
<p>At the close of school Helen met Margaret
Stevens in the hall outside the assembly room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is my first assignment going to be?&rdquo;
asked Helen&rsquo;s reporting staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be a good idea if you went
to the teachers and got all the school news,&rdquo; Helen
suggested. &ldquo;It is almost the end of the year and
most of the classes are planning parties and programs
of various kinds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it right away,&rdquo; promised Margaret and
she hurried off on her first newspaper assignment.</p>
<p>Helen smiled at her friend&rsquo;s enthusiasm and
she hoped that it wouldn&rsquo;t wear off for Margaret
was clever, knew a great many people and could
be a real help if she made up her mind to gather
news. In return, all Helen could offer would be
the experience and the closer friendship which
their constant association would mean.</p>
<p>The young editor of the <i>Herald</i> walked down
the street alone, for most of the students had left
the building while she had been talking with
Margaret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>When she reached the <i>Herald</i> office she heard
the steady hum of the electric motor of the Linotype
and the clack of its long arm as Tom sent
the lines of matrices into the mould to come out in
the form of shiny, hot lead slugs&mdash;new type for
their first edition of the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<p>Tom rose from his chair before the Linotype
keyboard and came into the editorial office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine story on the storm,&rdquo; he told
Helen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so interesting I can&rsquo;t make any time
getting it into type; keep stopping to read your
descriptions again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got another good story,&rdquo; Helen replied,
and she told her brother all about the visit of the
state superintendent of schools and of his praise
for the local school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a front page we&rsquo;ll have to send to Dad,&rdquo;
chuckled Tom. &ldquo;And to match your good news
stories, I made the rounds of the stores the first
thing this afternoon and got the ads lined up. I
couldn&rsquo;t get the copy for all of them but I know
just how much space each store will take. We&rsquo;ll
have a &lsquo;pay dirt&rsquo; issue this week with a little more
than 250 inches of ads and at 25 cents a column
inch that means better than $60 worth of business.
Not bad for a starter, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that crowd the inside pages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Tom conceded, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve got to
make every cent we can. I&rsquo;ve been doing a little
figuring on our expenses and how much business
we ought to have. We think of the <i>Herald</i> as an
eight page paper. That&rsquo;s true, but four of the
pages are printed at Cranston by the Globe Printing
Company with our serial story, pictures of
news of the world, fashion and menu suggestions
and world news in general on them. We seldom
if ever put ads on our front page and that leaves
only three pages for which we can sell ads and on
which we must earn enough to pay expenses, keep
the family going and build up a surplus to take
care of Dad when he needs more money. Those
three six column pages have 360 column inches,
120 to each page, and at our rate of 25 cents an
inch for advertising we&rsquo;ve got to sell a lot to make
the grade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t figured it out like that,&rdquo; Helen admitted,
&ldquo;but of course you&rsquo;re right. Can&rsquo;t we
expand the paper some way to get more business?
Only this morning the farmer that came in to see
about the sale bills said he wished we would run a
farm page and the school superintendent would
like to have a school page next fall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The farm page,&rdquo; Tom said, &ldquo;would undoubtedly
bring us more business and the first time I
have a half day to spare I&rsquo;ll take the old car and
go down to Gladbrook and see the county agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can get some job work from the offices
at the courthouse,&rdquo; he added hopefully.</p>
<p>The telephone rang and Helen answered the
call. It was from a woman who had out-of-town
guests and the young editor jotted the names down
on a pad of paper. That done she turned to her
typewriter and wrote the item, for with her half
days to work she had to write her stories as soon
as she had them.</p>
<p>Margaret bounced in with a handful of notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got half a dozen school stories,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Almost every teacher had something
for me and they&rsquo;re anxious to see their school
news in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they would be,&rdquo; Helen smiled. &ldquo;Can
you run a typewriter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a total stranger,&rdquo; Margaret confessed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do a lot better if I scribble my stories in longhand,
if Tom thinks he can read my scrawls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; came the reply from the composing
room, &ldquo;but I absolutely refuse to stand on my
head to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not that bad,&rdquo; laughed Margaret,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll try to do especially well for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen provided her first assistant with copypaper
and Margaret sat down at the desk to write
her stories. The editor of the <i>Herald</i> then devoted
her attention to writing up the notes she had taken
in her talk with the state superintendent of schools.
It was a story that she found slow to write for she
wanted no mistakes in it.</p>
<p>The afternoon was melting in a soft May twilight
when Tom snapped the switch on the Linotype
and came into the editorial office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost six o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and time for us
to head for home and supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margaret, who had been at the desk writing for
more than an hour, straightened her cramped
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I never thought reporting
could be such work and yet so much fun.
I&rsquo;m getting the biggest thrill out of my stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all the pay you will get,&rdquo; grinned
Tom.</p>
<p>They closed the office and started home together.
They had hardly gone a block when Helen
stopped suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the office key, Tom,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
started a letter to Dad this morning and it got
sidetracked when someone came in. I&rsquo;m going back
and get it. I can finish it at home and mail it on
the seven-fifteen when I come down to meet the
train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it for you,&rdquo; said Tom and started on
the run for the office. He got her half-finished
letter, and rejoined Helen and Margaret, who had
walked slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll add a few lines to your letter,&rdquo; Tom said.
&ldquo;Dad will be glad to know we&rsquo;ve lined up a lot of
ads for our first issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens came out of his office and joined
them in their walk home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are all the storm victims?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting along fine,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
understand why there weren&rsquo;t more serious injuries.
The storm was terrific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is because most of them heard it
coming and sought shelter in the strongest buildings
or took refuge in cellars,&rdquo; suggested Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s the explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll finish my school stories tomorrow afternoon,&rdquo;
promised Margaret as she turned toward
her home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>The twilight hour was the one that Helen liked
best of all the busy hours of her day. From the
porch she could look down at the long, deep-blue
stretch of water that was Lake Dubar while a
liquid-gold sun settled into the western hills.
Purple shadows in the little valleys bordering the
lake, lights gleaming from farm house windows
on far away hills, the mellow chime of a freight
train whistling for a crossing and over all a pervading
calmness that overcame any feeling of
fatigue and brought only a feeling of rest and
quiet to Helen. It was hard to believe that a little
more than 24 hours before this peaceful scene had
been threatened with total destruction by the fury
of the elements.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s mother called and the <i>Herald</i> editor
went into the dining room. Tom, his hands
scrubbed clean of printer&rsquo;s ink, was at the table
when Helen took her place.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair bowed her head in silent prayer and
Tom and Helen did likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see you working in the garden this
morning when I went down the lake with Jim
Preston?&rdquo; Helen asked her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. I&rsquo;m planning a larger garden than
ever. We can cut down on our grocery bills if
we raise more things at home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to do too much,&rdquo; Tom warned, &ldquo;for
we&rsquo;re depending on you as the boss of this outfit
now. I&rsquo;ll help you with the garden every chance
I get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will,&rdquo; his mother replied, &ldquo;but I
thoroughly enjoy working outdoors. If you&rsquo;ll
take care of the potato patch, I&rsquo;ll be able to do the
rest and still find time to write a few social items
for the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get any today?&rdquo; Helen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly half a dozen. The Methodist Ladies
Aid is planning a spring festival, an afternoon of
quilting and a chicken dinner in the evening with
everyone invited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a feed they put out,&rdquo; added Tom.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to see their officers and get an ad for the
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supper over and the dishes washed, dried and
put away, Helen turned her attention to finishing
the letter to her father. Tom also sat down to
write a note and when they had finished Mrs. Blair
put their letters in the envelope with her own,
sealed it and gave it to Helen.</p>
<p>Margaret Stevens stuck her head in the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going up to school for the sophomore-junior
debate?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to meet the seven-fifteen first,&rdquo; Helen
replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you at school about seven-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Marg,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I guess
I&rsquo;ll go along and see just how badly the sophomores
are beaten. Of course you know you kids
haven&rsquo;t got a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Tom,&rdquo; Helen warned. &ldquo;Margaret
is captain of our debate team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; chuckled Tom. &ldquo;No offense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be an offense, though,&rdquo; smiled Margaret,
&ldquo;and the juniors will be on the receiving end
of our verbal attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for a counter attack,&rdquo; Tom grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be home early, mother,&rdquo; said Helen as
they left the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the sophomores win,&rdquo; her mother said.
&ldquo;Tom and his juniors are too sure of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seven-fifteen coughed its way into town,
showering the few people on the platform with
cinders. Helen ran to the mail car and dropped
her letter into the mail slot.</p>
<p>Mr. King, the state superintendent of instruction,
was the only passenger leaving but there
were several Rolfe people getting off the train.
She got their names and stopped to talk a minute
or two with the agent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have some news for next week&rsquo;s paper,&rdquo;
he told her, but refused to say another word about
the promised story and Helen went on to the high
school.</p>
<p>The assembly was well filled with students and
a scattering of parents whose children were taking
part in the inter-class debate. The senior debaters
had already eliminated the freshmen and the winner
of the sophomore-junior debate would meet the
seniors for the championship of the school.</p>
<p>Helen looked around for a seat and was surprised
to see her mother beside Mrs. Stevens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you planned to come,&rdquo; Helen
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; smiled her mother, &ldquo;but just after
you left Mrs. Stevens ran over and I decided to
come with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The debate was on the question of whether the
state should adopt a paving program which would
reach every county. The sophomores supported
the affirmative and the juniors the negative. The
question was of vital interest for it was to come to
a vote in July and, if approved, Rolfe would get a
place on the scenic highway which would run
along the western border of the state, through the
beautiful lake country. It would mean an increased
tourist trade and more business for Rolfe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Margaret had marshalled her facts into impressive
arguments and the weight of the evidence was
with her team but the juniors threw up a smoke
screen of ridicule to hide their weaker facts and
Helen felt her heart sinking as the debate progressed.
Margaret made the final rebuttal for the
sophomores and gave a masterful argument in
favor of the paved road program but the last
junior speaker came back with a few humorous
remarks that could easily confuse the judges into
mistaking brilliant humor for facts.</p>
<p>The debate closed and the judges handed their
slips with their decisions to Superintendent
Fowler. Every eye in the assembly watched the
superintendent as he unfolded the slips and jotted
down the results. He stood up behind his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The judges vote two to one in favor of the
sophomores,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>There was a burst of applause and students and
parents crowded around the victorious team to
congratulate it. When it was all over, Mrs.
Blair, Mrs. Stevens, Margaret, Helen and Tom
started home together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we didn&rsquo;t have a chance,&rdquo; Margaret
chided Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still think we have the best team,&rdquo; insisted
Tom. &ldquo;The judges got a little confused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they were confused, Tom,&rdquo; his mother said,
&ldquo;it was by the juniors. Your team didn&rsquo;t have the
facts; they resorted to humor and ridicule. I
think it is a fine victory for the sophomores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tuesday morning Helen looked over the stories
Margaret had written the afternoon before and
wrote a long story about the sophomore-junior
debate, stressing the arguments in favor of the
paving program which the sophomores had
brought out. She was thoroughly in agreement
and meant to devote space in the <i>Herald</i>, both
editorially and from a news standpoint, to furthering
the passage of the good roads program.</p>
<p>The farmer who had called the day before came
in with his copy for the ad and sale bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked over the farm page idea with my
brother,&rdquo; Helen told him, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll get one
started just as soon as he can find the time to go
to Gladbrook and see the county agent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; replied the farmer,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll pass the word around to our neighbors.
Also, if you had a column of news each week from
the courthouse it would help your paper. A lot of
farmers take one of the Gladbrook papers just for
that reason. They want courthouse news and
can&rsquo;t get it in the <i>Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that, too,&rdquo; promised Helen.</p>
<p>She had almost forgotten that she was to write
to the state bureau of the Associated Press and
apply for the job as correspondent for Rolfe and
the nearby vicinity. She wrote one letter, was dissatisfied,
tore it up and wrote a second and then
a third before she was ready to mail it. As Tom
had said, it would be one way of increasing their
income and at the same time might help her to
secure a job later.</p>
<p>Margaret finished her school stories after school
that afternoon and Helen visited all of the stores
down town in search of personals. Several fishermen
had been fined for illegal fishing and she got
that story from the justice of the peace. She
called on the ministers and got their church notices.</p>
<p>Wednesday was their big day and Helen worked
hard all morning writing her personals. The main
news stories about the storm, the visit of the state
superintendent and the high school debate were
already in type and Tom had finished setting most
of the ads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>When Helen came down after school Tom called
her into the composing room. He had the ads for
the two inside pages placed in the forms. One
of the pages they devoted to the editorials and the
other they filled with personal items about the
comings and goings of local people.</p>
<p>The ads were placed well in the pages and when
Tom finished putting in the type he stood back
and looked at his handiwork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call that mighty good makeup,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Pyramiding the ads on the left side of the page
makes them look better and then we always have
news on the right-hand side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen agreed that the pages were well made up
and Tom locked the type into the steel forms,
picked up one of the pages and carried it to the
press. The other page was put on and locked into
place.</p>
<p>Tom washed his hands and climbed up to take
his place on the press. The paper for that issue of
the <i>Herald</i> had come down from Cranston the day
before with four pages, two and three and six and
seven already printed. Pages four and five, filled
with local news and ads, were on the press. Tom
would get them printed in the next two hours and
on Thursday afternoon would make up and print
page one and page eight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>He smoothed the stack of paper on the feeding
board, put a little glycerine on his fingers so he
could pick up each sheet and feed it into the press,
and then threw on the switch. The motor hummed.
Tom fed one sheet into the press and pushed
in the clutch. The press shook itself out of its
week-long slumber, groaned in protest at the
thought of printing another week&rsquo;s issue, but at
the continued urging of the powerful motor,
clanked into motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how the ink looks,&rdquo; Tom called and Helen
seized the first few papers. Her brother stopped
the press and climbed down to look over the pages
for possible corrections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks all right,&rdquo; he conceded as he scanned the
cleanly printed page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how Dad will like our new editorial
head and the three column box head I set for your
personals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll like them,&rdquo; Helen said. &ldquo;The only reason
he didn&rsquo;t do things like that was because he didn&rsquo;t
have the strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom nodded, wiped a tear from his eyes, and
went back to feeding the press. Helen kept the
papers stacked neatly as they came out and it was
nearly six o&rsquo;clock before Tom finished the first
run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go home and get something to eat,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and then come back. I&rsquo;ve got some more
copy to set on the Linotype and you write your last
minute stories. Maybe we&rsquo;ll have time to make up
part of the front page before we go home tonight.
I&rsquo;d like to have you here and we&rsquo;ll write the heads
together and see how they look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to head all of the front page
stories?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have time,&rdquo; Tom replied. &ldquo;It improves
the looks of the paper; makes it look newsy and
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supper was waiting for them when they reached
home and Tom handed his mother a copy of the
two inside pages they had just printed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks fine,&rdquo; enthused Mrs. Blair, &ldquo;and the
ads are so well arranged and attractive. Tom,
you&rsquo;ve certainly worked hard, and, Helen, I don&rsquo;t
see where you got so many personals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to use your column of social news
on page eight,&rdquo; Tom went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the last
run and in that way we can be sure of getting in
all of your news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have three more items,&rdquo; said his mother.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all written and ready to be set up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going back for a while after supper,&rdquo;
said Helen, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think it will take us over
a couple of hours to finish, do you, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About nine-thirty,&rdquo; replied Tom, who was devoting
himself whole-heartedly to a large baked
potato.</p>
<p>When they returned to the office Helen finished
the last of her items in half an hour. By eight-thirty
Tom had all of the news in type and had
made the necessary corrections from the proofs
which Helen had read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a head for the storm story,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;A three line, three column 30 point one ought to
be about right. You jot one down on a sheet of
paper and I&rsquo;ll try and make it fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen worked several minutes on a headline.
&ldquo;This is the best I can do,&rdquo; she said:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;TORNADO CAUSES $150,000 DAMAGE
<br />NEAR ROLFE SUNDAY; MISSES TOWN
<br />BUT STRIKES RESORT ALONG LAKE&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds fine,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll see how it
fits.&rdquo; He set up the headline and Helen wrote a
two column one for the story of the Rolfe school
being the best for its size in the state.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Tom put the headlines on the front page and
placed the stories under them. Shorter stories,
some of them written by Margaret, filled up the
page and they turned their attention to page eight,
the last one to be made up.</p>
<p>Their mother&rsquo;s social items led the page, followed
by the church notices and the last of Helen&rsquo;s
personals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got about ten inches too much type,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;See if some of the personals can&rsquo;t be
left out and run next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen culled out six items that could be left out
and Tom finished making up the page. Tomorrow
he would print the last two pages and Helen
would assemble the papers and fold them. Their
first issue of the <i>Herald</i> was ready for the press.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br /><i>Mystery in the Night</i></h2>
<p>Helen and Tom hurried home from school
Thursday noon, ate a hasty lunch and then went
on to the <i>Herald</i> office to finish their task of putting
out their first issue of the paper.</p>
<p>Helen stopped at the postoffice for the mail and
Tom went on to unlock the office, put the pages on
the press and start printing the last run.</p>
<p>In the mail Helen found a letter postmarked
Rubio, Arizona, and in her Father&rsquo;s familiar
handwriting. She ran into the <i>Herald</i> office and
on into the composing room where Tom was locking
the last page on the old flat-bed press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a letter from Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what he has
to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen was about to tear open the envelope when
she paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;Mother ought to be the
one to read it first. I&rsquo;ll call her and tell her it&rsquo;s
here. She&rsquo;ll want to come down and get it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; agreed Tom as he climbed up
on the press. He turned on the motor and threw
in the clutch. The old machine clanked back and
forth, gathering momentum for the final run of
the week.</p>
<p>Helen eagerly scanned the front page as it came
off the press. It was heavy with fresh ink but she
thrilled at the makeup on page one. There were
her stories, the one about the tornado and the other
about the high standing of the local school. Tom&rsquo;s
heads looked fine. The paper was bright and
newsy&mdash;easy to read. She hoped her Dad would
be pleased.</p>
<p>With the final run on the press it was Helen&rsquo;s
task to assemble and fold the papers. She donned
a heavy apron, piled the papers on one of the
makeup tables and placed a chair beside her. With
arms moving methodically, she started to work,
folding the papers and sliding them off the table
onto the chair.</p>
<p>Tom had just got the press running smoothly
when there was a grinding crash followed by the
groaning of the electric motor.</p>
<p>Helen turned quickly. Something might have
happened to Tom. He might have slipped off his
stool and fallen into the machinery of the press.</p>
<p>But Tom was all right. He reached for the
switch and shut off the power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; gasped Helen, her face still
white from the shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breakdown,&rdquo; grunted Tom disgustedly. &ldquo;This
antique has been ready for the junk pile for years
but Dad never felt he could afford to get a new
one or even a good second-hand one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we do?&rdquo; asked Helen anxiously.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get the paper out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run down to the garage and get Milt Pearsall
to come over. He&rsquo;s a fine mechanic and Dad
has called on him before when things have gone
wrong with the press.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom hastened out and Helen resumed her task
of folding the few papers which had been printed
before the breakdown. Everything had been
going so smoothly until this trouble. Now they
might be delayed hours if the trouble was anything
serious.</p>
<p>She heard someone call from the office. It was
her mother and she hastened out of the composing
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the letter,&rdquo; she said, pulling it out of a
pocket in her dress. &ldquo;We knew you&rsquo;d be anxious
to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you open it and then telephone
me?&rdquo; her mother asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We could have done that,&rdquo; Helen admitted,
&ldquo;but we thought you&rsquo;d like to be the first to open
and read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so thoughtful,&rdquo; murmured her mother.
With hands that trembled in spite of her effort to
be calm, she opened the letter and unfolded the
single page it contained. Helen waited, tense, until
her mother had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Dad?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His letter is very cheerful,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Blair,
handing it to Helen. &ldquo;Naturally he is tired but he
says the climate is invigorating and he expects to
feel better soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he will,&rdquo; agreed Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The press broke down and he went to the
garage to get Milt Pearsall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s nothing serious,&rdquo; said her mother.
&ldquo;Is there something I can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got the time to spare, I&rsquo;d like to have
you look over our first issue. Here&rsquo;s a copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s mother scanned the paper with keen,
critical eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks wonderful to me,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I
like the heads on the front page and you&rsquo;ve so
many good stories. Tom did splendidly on the ads.
How proud your father will be when he gets a
copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps you&rsquo;d like to write his address
on a wrapper and we&rsquo;ll put it in the mail
tonight when the other papers go out,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair nodded and addressed the wrapper
Helen supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sure there&rsquo;s nothing I can do at the
office,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on to the kensington at
Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to pick up all the news you can at
the party,&rdquo; cautioned Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; promised her mother.</p>
<p>Helen had just finished folding the papers when
Tom returned with Milt Pearsall.</p>
<p>The mechanic was a large, heavy-set man with
a mop of unruly hair, eyes that twinkled a merry
blue, and lips that constantly smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Editor,&rdquo; he boomed. &ldquo;Press broke
again, Tom says. Huh, expected it to happen most
anytime. Well, let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He eased his bulk down under the press, dug
into his tool kit for a flashlight and wormed his
way into the machinery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me the long wrench,&rdquo; he directed Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>The request complied with, there followed a
number of thumps and whacks of steel against
steel, a groan as Pearsall bumped his head in the
crowded quarters, and finally a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
<p>The mechanic crawled from under the press, a
smudge of ink across his forehead. He wiped his
hands thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; he ventured, &ldquo;that old press is
going to fall apart and I won&rsquo;t be able to tease
it back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the trouble?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross bar slipped out of place and dropped
down so it caught and held the bed of the press
from moving. Good thing you shut off the power
or you might have snapped that rod. Then we&rsquo;d
have been out of luck until I could have made a
new one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much will it be?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>
<p>The big mechanic grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Tom,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Just
forget to send me a bill for my subscription. That&rsquo;s
the way your Dad and I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot for helping us out,&rdquo; said Tom,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll see that you don&rsquo;t get a subscription dun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Tom climbed back to his place on the press,
turned on the power and eased the clutch in gently.
Helen watched anxiously, afraid that they might
have another breakdown but the old machine
clanked along steadily and she picked up the
mounting pile of papers and returned to her task
of folding.</p>
<p>Paper after paper she assembled, folded and
slid onto the pile on the chair. When the chair
overflowed with papers she stopped and carried
them into the editorial office and piled them on the
floor.</p>
<p>Tom finished his press run and went into the
editorial office to get out their old hand mailer and
start running the papers through to stamp the
names and addresses on each one.</p>
<p>After an hour of steady folding Helen&rsquo;s arms
ached so severely she stopped working and went
into the editorial office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting tired?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You run the mailer for a while and I&rsquo;ll fold
papers,&rdquo; said her brother. &ldquo;That will give you a
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen agreed and they switched work. She
clicked the papers through the mailer at a steady
pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Papers ready?&rdquo; called the postmaster from his
office in the front half of the <i>Herald</i> building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city list is stamped and ready,&rdquo; replied
Helen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring them in right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Hughes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save you
a trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter of fact,&rdquo; continued the postmaster
when he entered the office, &ldquo;I wanted to see what
kind of an issue you two kids got out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen handed him an unstamped paper and he
sat down in the one vacant chair. She valued the
old postmaster&rsquo;s friendship highly and awaited his
comment with unusual interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the best issues of the <i>Herald</i> I&rsquo;ve ever
seen,&rdquo; he enthused when he had finished looking
over the paper. &ldquo;Your stories have got all your
Dad&rsquo;s &lsquo;get up and go&rsquo; and these headlines are something
new for the <i>Herald</i>. Believe I like &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people may not,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;so we&rsquo;ll
appreciate all of the boosting you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do plenty,&rdquo; he chuckled as he picked up an
armful of papers and returned to the postoffice.</p>
<p>Margaret Stevens bustled in after school in time
to help carry the last of the papers to the postoffice
and she insisted on sweeping out the editorial office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just &lsquo;white&rsquo; tired,&rdquo; she scolded Helen.
&ldquo;Sit down and I&rsquo;ll swing this broom a few times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a little tired,&rdquo; admitted Helen. &ldquo;How
about you, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me for bed just as soon as I get home and have
something to eat,&rdquo; agreed her brother. &ldquo;Guess
we were all worked up and nervous over our first
issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were a real help, Margaret,&rdquo; said Helen,
&ldquo;and I hope you&rsquo;ll like reporting well enough to
stick with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy about it,&rdquo; replied Margaret, wielding
the broom with new vigor.</p>
<p>Conversation among the sophomores the next
morning at school was devoted solely to the class
picnic in the afternoon. The refreshment committee
had been busy and each member of the class
was to furnish one thing. Helen was to bring
pickles and Margaret&rsquo;s mother was baking a large
chocolate cake.</p>
<p>The class was dismissed at noon for the rest of
the day, to meet again at one o&rsquo;clock at Jim Preston&rsquo;s
boat landing for the trip down the lake to the
picnic grounds on Linder&rsquo;s farm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>There were 18 in the sophomore class and it
was necessary for the boatman to make two trips
with the <i>Liberty</i> to transport them to the picnic
grounds. Helen and Margaret were in the first
boat load and were the first ones out on the sandy
beach at Linder&rsquo;s. The rambling old farmhouse,
famous for its home cooked chicken dinners, set
back several hundred feet from the lake shore. To
the left of the farm was a dense grove of maples.
The picnic was to be along the shore just in front
of the maples where there was ample shade to
protect the group from the warm rays of the sun.</p>
<p>Miss Carver, the class advisor, rented two rowboats
at Linder&rsquo;s, and the class took turns enjoying
cruises along the shore, hunting unusual rocks and
shells for their collection at school.</p>
<p>The day previous Miss Carver and another
teacher had come down the lake and made arrangements
for a treasure hunt. The first clue was to
be revealed at three o&rsquo;clock and the class, divided
into two groups, was to compete to see which
group could find the hidden treasure. The first
clue took them to the Linder farmyard, the second
through the maples to an old sugarhouse, and the
third brought them out of the timber and along
a meadow where placid dairy cattle looked at them
with wondering eyes. The fourth clue was found
along the stream which cut through the meadow
and Helen, leading one group, turned back toward
the lake. A breeze was freshening out of the west
and the sun dropped rapidly toward the shadows
which were enfolding the hills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>The final clue took them back to their picnic
ground and they arrived just ahead of Margaret
and her followers to claim the prize, a two pound
box of chocolates.</p>
<p>Miss Carver had laid out the baskets and
hampers of food and the girls, helped by the boys
in their clumsy way, started serving the supper.</p>
<p>One of the boys built a bonfire and with the
coming of twilight and the cooling of the air its
warmth felt good. The flames chased the shadows
back toward the timber and sent dancing reflections
out on the ruffled waters of Lake Dubar.</p>
<p>The afternoon in the open had whetted their
appetites and they enjoyed their meal to the fullest.
Thick, spicy sandwiches disappeared as if by
magic, pickles followed in quick order and the
mounds of potato salad melted away.</p>
<p>They stopped for a second wind before attacking
the cakes and cookies but when those fortresses
of food had been conquered the boys cut
and sharpened sticks and the girls opened a large
sack of marshmallows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>More wood was heaped on the fire and they
gathered around the flames to toast the soft, white
cubes.</p>
<p>With the wind whispering through the trees
and the steady lap, lap, lap of the waves on the
shore, it was the hour for stories and they settled
back from the fire to listen to Miss Carver, whose
reputation as a story teller was unexcelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a night like this,&rdquo; she started, &ldquo;and a
class something like this one was on a picnic.
After supper they sat down at the fire to tell
ghost stories, each one trying to outdo the other
in the horror of the things they told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From somewhere through the night came a long
drawn out cry rising from a soft note to a high
crescendo that sent shivers running up and down
the back of everyone at the fireside.</p>
<p>Helen laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the whistle of a freight train,&rdquo; she
assured the others, but they all moved closer to the
fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;While they told stories,&rdquo; went on Miss Carver,
&ldquo;the blackness of the night increased, the stars
faded and over all there was a canopy of such
darkness as had never been seen before. The
wind moaned dismally like a lost soul and the
waters of the lake, white-capped by the breeze,
chattered against the rocky beach. The last ghost
story was being told by one of the boys. He told
how people disappeared as if by magic, leaving no
trace behind them, uttering no sound. Some of
the other stories had been surprising, but this one
gave the class the creeps and everyone turned to
see if the others were there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Involuntarily Helen reached out to clasp
Margaret&rsquo;s hand and when she failed to find it,
turned to the spot where Margaret had been sitting
beside her a few minutes before.</p>
<p>Margaret had disappeared!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br /><i>Rescue on Lake Dubar</i></h2>
<p>Helen stared hard at the place where her friend
should have been. Had the magic of Miss Carver&rsquo;s
story been so strong that she was imagining
things? She rubbed her eyes and looked again.
There was no mistake. Margaret had disappeared!</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s cry caught the attention of the other
members of the class and Miss Carver stopped her
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Helen?&rdquo; the teacher asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; cried Helen dazedly, pointing to the
spot where Margaret had been sitting, &ldquo;Margaret&rsquo;s
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Carver&rsquo;s eyes widened and she gave a little
shudder. Then she smiled to reassure Helen and
the other members of the class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably Margaret slipped away and is hiding
just to add a thrill to my ghost story. I&rsquo;ll call
her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Margaret, oh, Margaret!&rdquo; The teacher&rsquo;s
voice rang through the night. She cupped her
hands and called again when there was no response
to her first one. Once more she called but still
there was no answer from the massed maples behind
them or the dark waters of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is more than a joke,&rdquo; muttered Ned
Burns, the class president. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get out
and have a look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped toward the fire, threw on an armful
of fresh, dry sticks, and the flames leaped higher,
throwing their reflection further into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a look into the woods,&rdquo; he told Miss
Carver, &ldquo;and you and the girls hunt along the lake
shore. Margaret might have fallen and hurt herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Carver agreed and the girls gathered
around her. There was a queer tightness in
Helen&rsquo;s throat and a tugging at her heart that
unnerved her&mdash;a vague, pressing fear that something
was decidedly wrong with Margaret.</p>
<p>The boys disappeared into the shadows of the
timber and the girls turned toward the lake shore.</p>
<p>They had just started their search when Miss
Carver made an important discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;One of the rowboats we
rented this afternoon is missing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Helen ran toward the spot, the other girls
crowding around her. They could make out the
marks of the boat&rsquo;s keel in the sand and a girl&rsquo;s
footprints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those prints were made by Margaret&rsquo;s shoes,&rdquo;
said Helen. &ldquo;You can see the marks of the heel
plates she has on her oxfords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call the boys,&rdquo; said Miss Carver, and
Helen thought she detected a real note of alarm
in the teacher&rsquo;s voice although Miss Carver was
making every possible effort to appear calm.</p>
<p>When the boys arrived, Miss Carver told them
of their discovery and Ned Burns took charge of
the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get in the other rowboat,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
start looking for Margaret. In the meantime,
someone must go up to Linder&rsquo;s farmhouse and
telephone town. Margaret&rsquo;s father ought to know
she&rsquo;s out on the lake in the boat. Also call Jim
Preston and if he hasn&rsquo;t started down with the
<i>Liberty</i>, have him come at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the farm,&rdquo; volunteered Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.,&rdquo; nodded Ned as he selected two other
boys to accompany him in the rowboat. They
pushed off the sandy beach, dropped the oars in
the locks, and splashed away into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want someone to go to the farmhouse
with you?&rdquo; Miss Carver asked Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>But Helen shook her head and ran up the beach.
She didn&rsquo;t want anyone with her; she wanted to
be alone. The other girls didn&rsquo;t realize the seriousness
of the situation. She could understand
what Margaret had done. Realizing that Miss
Carver would tell them a first rate thriller of a
ghost story, Margaret had decided to add an extra
thrill by disappearing for a few minutes. But
something had gone wrong and she hadn&rsquo;t been
able to get back.</p>
<p>Helen paused and looked over the black, mysterious
waters of Lake Dubar. What secret were
they keeping from her? Thoughts of what might
have happened to Margaret brought the queer,
choky sobs again and she ran on toward Linder&rsquo;s
where the welcome glow of light showed through
the windows of the farmhouse.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Linder came to the door in answer to
Helen&rsquo;s quick, insistent knocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, young Lady?&rdquo; he asked,
peering at her through the mellow radiance of the
kerosene lamp which he held in one hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Helen Blair,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and one of
my classmates has disappeared from our picnic
party down the beach. One of the boats we rented
from you is missing and we&rsquo;re sure Margaret is
adrift on the lake and unable to get back. I&rsquo;d
like to use your telephone to let her father know
and to call Jim Preston.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Linder, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
wonder at your hurry. Come right in and use the
phone. Who did you say the girl was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margaret Stevens,&rdquo; Helen replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be Doctor Stevens&rsquo; daughter,&rdquo; said the
farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; Helen replied, as she reached the telephone
in the hallway.</p>
<p>While Helen was ringing for the operator at
Rolfe, Mr. Linder stuck his head in the living
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Doctor Stevens&rsquo; daughter is
adrift somewhere on the lake in one of our boats.
I&rsquo;m going down and see if I can help find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Linder came into the hall and Helen heard
her husband telling her what had happened. Then
the Rolfe operator answered and Helen gave her
the number of Doctor Stevens&rsquo; office.</p>
<p>The doctor answered almost instantly and
Helen, phrasing her sentences as tactfully as possible
so as not to unduly alarm the doctor, told
him what had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds just like Margaret,&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be right down. Now don&rsquo;t worry too much,
Helen,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, Doctor Stevens,&rdquo; promised Helen
with a shaky attempt at cheerfulness.</p>
<p>Then she called Jim Preston&rsquo;s home and learned
that he had left fifteen minutes before and should
be almost down to Linder&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down to the landing and wait for
Jim,&rdquo; said Mr. Linder as he lighted a lantern he
had brought from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything will come out all right,&rdquo; Mrs. Linder
assured Helen.</p>
<p>The farmer led the way down to the landing.
The wind was freshening rapidly and Helen saw
Mr. Linder anxiously watching the white caps
which were pounding against the sandy beach.</p>
<p>Down the beach their picnic campfire was a red
glow and Helen could see Miss Hughes and the
girls huddled around it. The boys who had not
accompanied Ned Burns were walking up and
down along the shore.</p>
<p>She turned and looked up the lake. Two lights,
one red and one green, the markers of the <i>Liberty</i>,
were coming down the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jim Preston will be here in another minute,&rdquo;
said Mr. Linder, &ldquo;and with the searchlight he&rsquo;s
got on the <i>Liberty</i> it won&rsquo;t take us long to find
Doctor Stevens&rsquo; daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen nodded miserably as the <i>Liberty</i> slowed
down and swung its nose toward the Linder pier.
There was the grinding of the reverse gear as Jim
Preston checked the speed of his boat and left it
drift against the pier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shut it off, Jim,&rdquo; cried the farmer. &ldquo;Doc
Stevens&rsquo; daughter is adrift in the lake in one of
my rowboats. We&rsquo;ve got to go out and look for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed into the boat and Jim Preston
backed the <i>Liberty</i> away from the pier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; he asked Helen. She told
him briefly and he shook his head, as though to
say, &ldquo;too bad, it&rsquo;s getting to be a nasty night on
the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boatman opened the throttle, the motor
roared its response and the <i>Liberty</i> leaped ahead
and down the lake. They ran parallel to the shore
until they were opposite the picnic ground. There
Jim Preston slowed down, got the direction of the
wind, and turned the nose of the <i>Liberty</i> toward
the open and now wind-tossed lake. He snapped
on the switch and a crackling, blue beam of light
cut a path ahead of the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep the searchlight moving,&rdquo; he directed the
farmer, who stood up in the <i>Liberty</i>, his hands on
the handles of the big, nickel lamp.</p>
<p>The boatman held the <i>Liberty</i> at about one third
speed and they moved almost directly across the
lake while Mr. Linder kept the searchlight swinging
in an arc to cover the largest possible area.</p>
<p>A third of the way across they sighted a boat
far to their right and Jim Preston swung the nose
of the <i>Liberty</i> around sharply and opened the
throttle. They sliced through the white caps at a
pace that drenched them with the flying spray but
they were too intent on reaching the distant boat
to stop and put up the spray boards.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s keen eyes were the first to identify the
boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the boys,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re beckoning
us on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim Preston checked the <i>Liberty</i> carefully and
nosed alongside the tossing rowboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sign of Margaret,&rdquo; admitted Ned Burns,
&ldquo;and the lake&rsquo;s getting too rough for us to stay
out much longer. We&rsquo;ve had half a dozen waves
break over us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get in with us,&rdquo; advised Preston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hand me the oars,&rdquo; said Mr. Linder, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ll let the rowboat drift. I&rsquo;ll pick it up in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys tossed their oars into the <i>Liberty</i> and
scrambled up into the motorboat.</p>
<p>Jim Preston threw in the clutch and the <i>Liberty</i>
leaped ahead to resume its search for Margaret.
Helen&rsquo;s lips were dry and fevered despite the
steady showers of spray and her heart hammered
madly. Lake Dubar had always had a nasty reputation
for ugliness in a fresh, sharp wind but
Helen had never before realized its true danger
and what a lost and helpless feeling one could have
on it at night, especially when a friend was missing.</p>
<p>There was no conversation as the <i>Liberty</i> continued
across the choppy expanse of the lake. The
searchlight picked up the far shore of the lake with
the waves hammering against the rocks which
lined that particular section. It was a grim, unnerving
picture and Helen saw Jim Preston&rsquo;s jaw
harden as he swung the <i>Liberty</i> around the cross
back to Linder&rsquo;s side of the lake.</p>
<p>Back and forth the searchlight swung in its
steady, never tiring arc, but it revealed only the
danger of Lake Dubar at night. There was no
sign of Margaret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>They reached the shore from which they had
started and turned around for a third trip across
the lake. This time they slapped through the
waves at twenty-five miles an hour and every eye
was trained to watch for some sign of the missing
boat and girl.</p>
<p>Helen caught a flash of white just as the searchlight
reached the end of its arc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I saw something far to
the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preston slapped the wheel of the <i>Liberty</i> over
and the speedboat roared away in the direction
Helen pointed, its questing searchlight combing
the waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is again,&rdquo; Helen cried and pointed
straight ahead where they could discern some object
half hidden by the waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of my boats,&rdquo; muttered old Mr.
Linder as they drew nearer, &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t look
like there was anyone in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;There
must be someone there. Margaret must be in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her heart she knew Mr. Linder was right.
The boat was rolling in the choppy waves and
there was no one visible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s half full of water,&rdquo; exclaimed Ned Burns
as they drew nearer and Jim Preston throttled
down the <i>Liberty</i> and eased in the clutch.</p>
<p>Helen pushed them aside and stared at the rowboat,
fully revealed in the glaring rays of the
searchlight. Tragedy was dancing on the waters
of Lake Dubar that night, threatening to write
an indelible chapter on the hearts of Helen and her
classmates for there was no sign of Margaret in
the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she shoved the boat out into the lake
and hid in the woods,&rdquo; said Ned Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; protested Helen.</p>
<p>They edged nearer the rowboat, Preston handling
the <i>Liberty</i> with care lest the waves created
by the boat&rsquo;s powerful propeller capsize the smaller
boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something or someone in the back
end,&rdquo; cried Ned Burns, who was three or four
inches taller than anyone else in the boat.</p>
<p>Helen stood on tip-toe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Margaret,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s
wrong. It looks like she&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But sleep in a water-logged rowboat in the
middle of Lake Dubar was out of the question and
Helen realized instantly that something unusual
had happened to Margaret, something which
would explain the whole joke which had turned out
to be such a ghastly nightmare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Jim Preston eased the <i>Liberty</i> alongside the
rowboat and Mr. Linder reached down and picked
Margaret up. There was a dark bruise over her
left eye and her clothes were soaked.</p>
<p>The boatman found an old blanket in one of the
lockers and they wrapped Margaret in it and pillowed
her head in Helen&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>Margaret&rsquo;s eyes were closed tightly but she was
breathing slowly and her pulse was irregular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry,&rdquo; Helen whispered to Jim Preston.
&ldquo;Head for Linder&rsquo;s. Her father will be there by
this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boatman sensed the alarm in Helen&rsquo;s words
and he jerked open the throttle of the <i>Liberty</i> and
sent the boat racing through the night. In less
than five minutes they were slowing down for the
pier. The lights of a car were at the shore end
of the landing and someone with an electric torch
was awaiting their arrival. It was Doctor Stevens,
pacing along the planks of the landing stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you found Margaret?&rdquo; he cried as the
<i>Liberty</i> sidled up to the pier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got her right here,&rdquo; replied Jim Preston, &ldquo;but
she&rsquo;s got a bad bump on her head.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Doctor Stevens jumped into the boat and turned
his flashlight on Margaret&rsquo;s face. Helen saw his
lips tighten into a thin straight line. He felt her
pulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run ahead,&rdquo; he told Ned Burns, &ldquo;and tell
Mother Linder to open one of those spare beds of
hers and get me plenty of hot water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped and picked Margaret up in his arms,
carrying her like a baby. Mr. Linder hurried
ahead to light the way.</p>
<p>Helen stopped to talk with Jim Preston for a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better take the class home,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more they can do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go back with them now?&rdquo; asked the
boatman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to stay here tonight. I&rsquo;ll phone
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen turned and ran toward the farmhouse.
Inside there was an air of quiet, suppressed activity.</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens had carried Margaret into the
large downstairs bedroom which Mother Linder
reserved for company occasions. Two kerosene
lamps on a table beside the bed gave a rich light
which softened the pallor of Margaret&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Doctor Stevens was busy with an injection from
a hypodermic needle, working as though against
time. Tragedy had danced on the tips of the
waves a few minutes earlier but how close it came
to entering the farmhouse only Doctor Stevens
knew at that hour for Margaret&rsquo;s strength, sapped
by the terrifying experience on the lake, was near
the breaking point and only the injection of a
strong heart stimulant saved her life.</p>
<p>Two hours later, hours which had been ages
long to Helen as she sat beside the bed with the
doctor, Margaret opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk, Marg,&rdquo; begged Helen. &ldquo;Everything
is all right. You&rsquo;re in a bedroom at the
Linders and your father is here with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margaret nodded slightly and closed her eyes.
It was another hour before she moved again and
when she did Mother Linder was at hand with a
steaming bowl of chicken broth. The nourishing
food plus the hour of calm sleep had partially restored
Margaret&rsquo;s strength and when she had
finished the broth she sat up in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been such a little fool,&rdquo; she said, but her
father patted her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize for what&rsquo;s happened,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just supremely happy to have you here,&rdquo;
his voice so low that only Margaret and Helen
heard him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would be a good joke to disappear
when Miss Carver started telling the ghost story,&rdquo;
explained Margaret. &ldquo;I got the boat out into the
lake without anyone seeing me and let it drift
several hundred feet. When I tried to put the oars
in the locks I stumbled, dropped them overboard
and that&rsquo;s the last I knew, except that for hours I
was falling, falling, falling, and always there was
the noise of the waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margaret slipped back into a deep, restful sleep
when she had finished her story. Helen, worn by
the hours of tension, slid out of her chair and onto
the floor, and when Doctor Stevens picked her up
she was sound asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br /><i>Behind the Footlights</i></h2>
<p>By the first of the following week the near
tragedy of the picnic seemed only a terrible nightmare
to Helen and Margaret and they devoted all
of their extra time to helping Tom get out the
next edition of the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<p>Monday morning&rsquo;s mail brought a long letter
from Helen&rsquo;s father, a letter in which he praised
them warmly for their first edition of the <i>Herald</i>.
He added that he had recovered from the fatigue
of his long trip into the southwest and was feeling
much stronger and a great deal more cheerful.
The newsy letter brightened the whole atmosphere
of the Blair home and for the first time since their
father had left, Tom and Helen saw their mother
like her old self, smiling, happy and humming little
tunes as she worked about the house.</p>
<p>Events crowded one on another as the school
year neared its close. There were final examinations,
the junior-senior banquet, the annual sophomore
party and finally, graduation exercises.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>The seniors had been rehearsing their play,
&ldquo;The Spell of the Image,&rdquo; for a month and for
the final week had engaged a special dramatic instructor
from Cranston to put the finishing
touches on the cast. Helen had read the play
several times. It was a comedy-drama concerning
the finding of an ancient and valuable string
of pearls in an old image. It had action, mystery
and romance and she thrilled when she thought
that in two more years she would be in her own
class play.</p>
<p>The dramatic instructor arrived. She was
Anne Weeks, a slender, dark-haired girl of 25
who had attended the state university and majored
in dramatics. Every boy in high school promptly
thought he was in love with her.</p>
<p>The seniors rehearsed their parts every spare
hour and every evening. The play was to go on
Thursday night with the graduation exercises
Friday evening.</p>
<p>Dress rehearsal was called for Tuesday and
Helen went down to the opera house to peek in and
see how it was going. She found a disconsolate
cast sitting around the stage, looking gloomily at
Miss Weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks more like a party of mourners than
a play practice,&rdquo; observed Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just about that bad,&rdquo; replied Miss Weeks.
&ldquo;Sarah Jacobs has come down with a severe cold
and can&rsquo;t talk, which leaves us in a fine pickle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she be able to go on Thursday night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be at least a week before she&rsquo;ll be able
to use her voice for a whole evening,&rdquo; Miss Weeks
said. &ldquo;In the meantime, we&rsquo;ve got to find another
girl, about Sarah&rsquo;s size, to play her part and every
member of the senior class is in the play now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly and looked at Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re about Sarah&rsquo;s size,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;and
you&rsquo;re blonde and you have blue eyes. You&rsquo;ll do,
Helen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do for what?&rdquo; asked the astounded Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, for Sarah&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Weeks. &ldquo;Come now, hurry up and get into Sarah&rsquo;s
costume,&rdquo; and she pointed to a dainty colonial
dress which the unfortunate Sarah was to have
worn in the prologue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know Sarah&rsquo;s part well enough,&rdquo;
said Helen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only read the play twice and
then just for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch on,&rdquo; said Miss Weeks, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re
half as smart as I think you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Helen,&rdquo; urged the seniors. &ldquo;Help us
out. We&rsquo;ve got to put the play across or we&rsquo;ll
never have enough money to pay Miss Weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you know why I&rsquo;m so anxious for you to
take the part,&rdquo; smiled the play instructor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; promised Helen, gathering the
costume under her arm and hurrying toward the
girls&rsquo; dressing room.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later she emerged as a dainty
colonial dame. Miss Weeks stared hard at her
and then smiled an eminently satisfactory smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if she can only get the lines in two
nights,&rdquo; she whispered to herself.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s reading of the play had given her a
thorough understanding of the action and they
went through the prologue without a slip. Scenery
was shifted rapidly and the stage changed from a
colonial ballroom to a modern garden scene. Costumes
kept up with the scenery and when the
members of the cast reappeared on the stage they
were dressed in modern clothes.</p>
<p>Helen poured over the pages of the play book
and because she had only a minor part in the first
act, got through it nicely. The second act was her
big scene and she was decidedly nervous when it
came time for her cue. One of the seniors was to
make love to her and she didn&rsquo;t especially like him.
But the play was the thing and the seniors certainly
did need someone to take the vacant part.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>She screwed up her courage and played the r&ocirc;le
for all it was worth. Once she forgot her lines
but she managed to fake a little conversation and
they got back to the regular lines without trouble.</p>
<p>When the curtain was rung down on the third
act Miss Weeks stepped out of the orchestra pit
where she had been directing the changes in minor
details of the action and came over to Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing splendidly,&rdquo; she told the young
editor of the <i>Herald</i>. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about lines.
Read them over thoroughly sometime tomorrow
and we&rsquo;ll put the finishing touches on tomorrow
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Helen reached home Tom had returned
from the office, his work done for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you were just going down the street
to see how play practice was coming?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Helen replied, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m so thrilled,
Tom. Sarah Jacobs, who has the juvenile lead in
the play is ill with a sore throat and Miss Weeks
asked me to take the part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; smiled Helen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve
been. Rehearsing for the play Thursday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a fine editor,&rdquo; growled Tom.
&ldquo;How am I going to get out the paper?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about copy,&rdquo;
Helen assured him. &ldquo;Margaret has half a dozen
stories to turn in tomorrow noon and I&rsquo;ll have all
of mine written by supper time. And I&rsquo;ll do my
usual work Thursday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just kidding,&rdquo; grinned Tom. &ldquo;I think
it&rsquo;s great that Miss Weeks picked you to fill in
during the emergency. Quite a compliment, I
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s mother, who had been across the street
at the Stevens&rsquo;, came home and Helen had to tell
her story over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about your costumes?&rdquo; asked her
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The class rents the colonial dress for the prologue,&rdquo;
explained Helen, &ldquo;and for the other acts
Miss Weeks is going to loan me some smart frocks
from her own wardrobe. We&rsquo;re practically the
same size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a break for you,&rdquo; Tom laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be the smartest dressed girl in the class if I know
anything about Miss Weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; retorted his sister.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s regular Wednesday morning round of
news gathering took her to the depot to meet the
nine forty-five and she found the agent waiting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Remember I promised you a story this week?&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to take it,&rdquo; Helen smiled. &ldquo;What
we want is news, more news and then more news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is really a good story,&rdquo; the railroad man
assured her. &ldquo;Wait until you see the nine forty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Is it two or three hours
late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be in right on time,&rdquo; the agent promised.</p>
<p>Helen sat down on a box on the platform to
await the arrival of the morning local. Resting
there in the warm sunshine, she pulled her copy
of the play book out of her pocket and read the
second act, with her big scene, carefully. The
words were natural enough and she felt that she
would have little trouble remembering them.</p>
<p>She glanced at the depot clock. It was nine
forty. The local should be whistling for the crossing
down the valley. She looked in the direction
from which the train was coming. There was no
sign of smoke and she knew it would be late.</p>
<p>She had picked up her play book and turned to
the third act when a mellow chime echoed through
the valley. It was like a locomotive whistle and
yet unlike one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;New whistle on the old engine?&rdquo; Helen asked
the agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; he grinned.</p>
<p>The <i>Herald&rsquo;s</i> editor watched for the train to
swing into sight around a curve but instead of
the black, stubby snout of the regular passenger
engine, a train of three cars, seemingly moving
without a locomotive, appeared and rolled
smoothly toward the station.</p>
<p>As it came nearer Helen could hear the low
roar of a powerful gasoline engine, which gradually
dropped to a sputtering series of coughs as
the three car train drew abreast the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Latest thing in local trains,&rdquo; exclaimed the
agent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gas-electric outfit with the motive
power in the front end of the first car. Fast, clean
and smooth and it&rsquo;s economical to run. Don&rsquo;t take
a fireman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen jotted down hasty notes. Everyone in
the town and countryside would be interested in
seeing and reading about the new train.</p>
<p>The agent gave Helen a hand into the cab where
the engineer obligingly explained the operation of
the gas-electric engine.</p>
<p>The conductor called &ldquo;All aboo-ord,&rdquo; and Helen
climbed down out of the cab.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>The gasoline engine sputtered as it took up the
load of starting the train. When the cars were
once under way, it settled down to a steady rumble
and the train picked up speed rapidly and rolled
out of town on its way to the state capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; asked the agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly a fine piece of equipment,&rdquo; said
Helen, &ldquo;but I hate to see the old steam engines
go. There&rsquo;s something much more romantic about
them than these new trains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll have steam on the freight trains,&rdquo;
the agent hastened to add. &ldquo;Give us a good write
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Helen promised as she started for the
<i>Herald</i> office to write her story of the passing of
the steam passenger trains on the branch line.</p>
<p>Margaret came in with a handful of school
stories she had written during an assembly hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; she said to Helen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
just heard about your part. You&rsquo;ll put it across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so, Marg, for I&rsquo;d hate to
make a fizzle of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen finished writing her copy for the paper
that afternoon after school and before she went
home to supper with Tom wrote the headlines for
the main stories on page one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you write a story about the sophomore
picnic and what happened to Margaret?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s with the copy I just put on your machine,&rdquo;
Helen replied. &ldquo;Everyone knows something about
it and of course there is a lot of talk. I&rsquo;ve seen
Doctor Stevens and Margaret and they both agree
that a story is necessary and that the simple truth
is the best thing to say with no apologies and nothing
covered up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc Stevens is a brick,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.
&ldquo;Most men would raise the very dickens if such a
story were printed but it will stop idle talk which
is certainly much worse than having the truth
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way he feels,&rdquo; Helen said.</p>
<p>Margaret came over after supper to go down to
the opera house with Helen for play practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting almost as big a thrill out of it as
Helen,&rdquo; she told Mrs. Blair, &ldquo;only I wouldn&rsquo;t be
able to put it across and Helen can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Weeks had brought three dresses for
Helen to wear, one for each act in the play. They
were dainty, colorful frocks that went well with
Helen&rsquo;s blondness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>The stage was set with all of the properties for
the prologue and Helen hastened into the girl&rsquo;s
dressing room to put on her colonial costume.
When she returned to the stage, Miss Weeks was
addressing the cast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; she warned them, &ldquo;that this is the
last rehearsal. Everything is just as it will be
tomorrow night. Imagine the audience is here tonight.
Play up to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The main curtain was dropped, the house lights
went off and the battery of brilliant electrics in the
footlights blazed.</p>
<p>The curtain moved slightly; then went up
smoothly and disappeared in the darkness above
the stage. The play was on.</p>
<p>The prologue went smoothly and without a mistake
and when the curtain dropped the stage became
a scene of feverish activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes to change,&rdquo; Miss Weeks warned
them as they went to their dressing rooms.</p>
<p>For the first act Helen was to wear a white
sport dress with a blazing red scarf knotted loosely
around her neck. She wiggled into her outfit,
brushed her hair with deft hands, dabbed fresh
powder on her cheeks, touched up her lips with
scarlet and was ready for her cue. She said her
lines with an ease and clearness that surprised
even herself and was back in the wings and on her
way to the dressing room almost before she
knew it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>In the second act Helen had her big part and
Miss Weeks had provided a black, velvet semiformal
afternoon gown. It was fashioned in plain,
clinging lines, caught around the waist with a
single belt of braided cloth of gold and with the
neckline trimmed in the same material. Golden
slippers and hose and one bracelet, a heavy, imitation
gold band, completed the accessories.</p>
<p>Between acts Miss Weeks came into see how
the costume fitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Helen,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gorgeous&mdash;beautiful.
Every boy in town will be crazy
about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll worry about that later,&rdquo; Helen replied.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m so glad you think I look all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfectly adorable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The praise from Miss Weeks buoyed Helen
with an inner courage that made her fairly sparkle
and she played her part for all it was worth.
Again she forgot her lines but she managed to
escape by faking conversation.</p>
<p>When the rehearsal was over, Margaret hastened
to the stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be the hit of the show,&rdquo; she whispered to
Helen. &ldquo;And think of it, one of the sophomores
running away with the seniors play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t intend to do that,&rdquo; Helen replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only here to help them out. Besides, I may
forget my lines and make some terrible mistake
tomorrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; Margaret insisted,
as they left the theater.</p>
<p>Thursday was Helen&rsquo;s busy day. Final examinations
for two periods in the morning and
then to the office after lunch to help Tom fold and
mail the week&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<p>Tom had put the two pages for the last run
on the press before going home for lunch so when
they returned the press was ready for the afternoon&rsquo;s
work.</p>
<p>Advertising had not been quite as heavy as
the first week and Tom had used every line of
copy Helen had written, but the paper looked clean
and readable.</p>
<p>Helen stacked the papers on the makeup table
and started folding. When Tom finished the
press run he folded while Helen started stamping
the names of the subscribers on the papers. By
four o&rsquo;clock every paper was in the postoffice and
half an hour later they were ready to call it a day
and lock up the office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>When Helen reached home her mother made her
go to her room and rest for an hour before supper.</p>
<p>They were eating when Margaret hurried in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are your tickets,&rdquo; she told Mrs. Blair. &ldquo;I
managed to get them exchanged so we&rsquo;ll all be
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you had decided not to go to the
play?&rdquo; Helen said to her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was before you had a part in it,&rdquo; smiled
Mrs. Blair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to sit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to know,&rdquo; put in Tom. &ldquo;If
you did, it would make you nervous. It&rsquo;s bad
enough to know that we&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cast had been called to meet on the stage
at seven-fifteen for last minute instructions. The
curtain was at eight-fifteen and that would give
them an hour to dress and get into makeup.</p>
<p>Miss Weeks had little to say when she faced the
group of seniors and the lone sophomore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that this is no different from last
night&rsquo;s rehearsal,&rdquo; she told them. &ldquo;Play up to
each other. If you forget a few lines, fake the
conversation until you can get back to your cues.
You will disappoint me greatly if you don&rsquo;t put
on the best senior play ever given in Rolfe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Then they were swept away in the rush of last
minute preparations for the first call. The girl&rsquo;s
dressing room was filled with the excited chatter
of a dozen girls and the air was thick with the
smell of grease paint and powder. Colonial costumes
came out of the large wardrobe which filled
one side of the room and there was the crisp
rustle of silk as the girls donned their costumes.
Miss Weeks moved through the room, adding a
touch of makeup here and taking off a bit where
some over-zealous young actress had been too enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes,&rdquo; Miss Weeks warned the girls.
&ldquo;Everyone out and on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general checkup on costumes and
stage properties. Through the heavy curtain
Helen heard the high school orchestra swing into
the overture. The electrician moved the rheostat
which dimmed the house lights. The banks of
electrics in the flies about the stage awoke into
glaring brilliance as the overture reached its crescendo.
The stage was very quiet. Everyone was
ready for the curtain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>All eyes were on Miss Weeks and Helen felt a
last second flutter of her heart. In another second
or two she would be in the full glare of the footlights.
She was thankful that she had only a
few lines in the prologue. It would give her
time to gain a stage composure and prepare for
her big scene in the second act.</p>
<p>Miss Weeks&rsquo; hand moved. The man at the curtain
shifted and it started slowly upward. Helen
blinked involuntarily as she faced the full glare
of the footlights. Beyond them she could see only
a sea of faces, extending row on row toward the
back of the theater. Somewhere out there her
mother and Tom would be watching her. And
with them would be Margaret and her parents.</p>
<p>The play was on and Helen forgot her first
nervousness. Dainty colonial dames moved about
the stage and curtsied before gallant white-wigged
gentlemen. The prologue was short but colorful.
Just enough to reveal that a precious string of
pearls had been hidden in the ugly little image
which reposed so calmly on a pedestal.</p>
<p>As the curtain descended, a wave of applause
reached the stage. It was ardent and prolonged
and Miss Weeks motioned for the cast to remain
in their places. The curtain ascended half way
and the cast curtsied before it descended again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing splendidly,&rdquo; Miss Weeks told
them. &ldquo;Now everyone to the dressing rooms to
change for the first act. Be back on the stage
ready to go in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls flocked to the dressing room. Colonial
costumes disappeared and modern dresses took
their place. Helen slipped into her white sport
outfit with the scarlet scarf. Her cheeks burned
with the excitement of the hour. She dabbed her
face with a powder puff and returned to the stage.
The scenery had been shifted for the first act and
the curtain went up on time to the second.</p>
<p>Helen felt much easier. Her first feeling of
stage fright had disappeared and she knew she
was the master of her own emotions. She refused
to think of the possibility of forgetting her lines
and resolved to put herself into the character she
was playing and do and act in the coming situations,
as that character would do.</p>
<p>Helen was on the stage only a few minutes during
the first act and she had ample time to change
for the second. The dressing room was almost
deserted and she took her time. The heavy, black
velvet dress Miss Weeks had loaned her was entrancing
in its rich beauty and distinctiveness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>She combed her blond hair until it looked like
burnished gold. Then she pulled it back and
caught it at the nape of her neck. It was the most
simple hair dress possible but the most effective in
its sheer simplicity.</p>
<p>Other girls crowded into the room. The first
act was over. Miss Weeks came in and Helen
stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, Helen, wonderful,&rdquo; murmured the
instructor, but not so loud that the other girls
would hear.</p>
<p>There was the call for the second act and Helen
went onto the stage. The senior she played opposite
came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Helen smiled, just a bit grimly, for she was
determined to play her part for all it was worth.</p>
<p>The orchestra stopped playing and the curtain
slid upward. She heard her cue and walked into
the radiance of the lights. She heard the senior,
her admirer in the play, talking to her. He was
telling her of his recent adventures and how, at
the end of a long, moonlit trail, he had finally
come upon the girl of his dreams.</p>
<p>Then she heard herself replying, protesting that
there was no such thing as love at first sight, but
that ardent young Irish adventurer refused no for
an answer and Helen backed away from him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>She heard a warning hiss from the wings but it
was too late. She walked backwards into a
pedestal with a vase of flowers.</p>
<p>There was a sudden crash of the falling pedestal
and the tinkle of breaking glass.</p>
<p>The audience roared with laughter.</p>
<p>Helen was stunned for the moment. In her
chance to make good in high school dramatics she
had clumsily backed into the stand and upset it,
breaking the vase. Tears welled into her eyes and
her lips trembled. The senior was staring at her,
too surprised to talk.</p>
<p>The laughter continued, and Helen seized the
only chance for escape. Could she make it appear
that the accident was a part of the play, a deliberate
bit of comedy?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smile,&rdquo; she whispered to the senior. &ldquo;We can
make it look like a part of the play. Follow my
cue.&rdquo; He nodded slightly to show that he understood.</p>
<p>The laughter subsided enough for them to continue
their lines and Helen managed to smile. She
hoped it wouldn&rsquo;t look too forced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look what you made me do,&rdquo; she said, pointing
at the wreckage of the vase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; smiled the senior. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just that way
about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they swung back into the lines of the play
and three minutes later Helen was again in the
wings.</p>
<p>Miss Weeks was waiting for her and Helen expected
a sharp criticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supreme comedy,&rdquo; congratulated the dramatic
instructor. &ldquo;How did you happen to think of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo; protested Helen. &ldquo;It
was an accident. I was scared to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Weeks stared at her hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she commented, &ldquo;you certainly carried
it off splendidly. It was the best comedy touch of
the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third act went on and then &ldquo;The Spell of
the Image&rdquo; was over. The curtain came down on
the final curtain call. The orchestra blared as the
audience left the hall while parents and friends
trooped onto the stage to congratulate the members
of the cast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Helen suddenly felt very tired and there was a
mist in her eyes, but she brightened visibly when
her mother and Tom, followed by the Stevens,
pushed through the crowd. She listened eagerly
to their praises and to Tom&rsquo;s whole-hearted exclamations
over her beauty and charm.</p>
<p>Then the lights of the stage dimmed. She had
had her hour as an actress; she knew she had acquitted
herself well. The smell of grease, paint
and powder faded and she was a newspaperwoman
again&mdash;the editor of the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br /><i>New Plans</i></h2>
<p>With the end of the school year Tom and Helen
were able to give their complete time and energies
to the <i>Herald</i>. When Monday, the first of June
arrived, they were working on their fourth issue
of the <i>Herald</i> and Helen had written a number of
stories on the last week&rsquo;s activities at school, the
graduation exercises, the junior-senior dinner and
the senior class play. She praised Miss Weeks
highly for her work with the class play and lauded
the seniors for their fine acting. Although urged
that she say something about her own part, Helen
steadfastly refused and her brother finally gave
up in disgust and delved in to the ledger for on
his shoulders fell the task of making out the
monthly bills and handling all of the business details
of the paper.</p>
<p>When Tom had completed his bookkeeping he
turned to his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not making enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Tom,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;the paper is carrying
more advertising than when Dad ran it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but our expenses are high,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to look ahead all the time. Dad will
have used all of the money he took with him in a
little less than six months. After that it will be
up to us to have the cash in the bank. Right now
we&rsquo;ve just a little under a hundred dollars in the
bank. Current bills will take more than that, and
our own living expenses, that is for mother and
we two, will run at least $100 a month. With our
total income from the paper only slightly more
than $200 a month on the basis of the present
amount of advertising, you see we&rsquo;re not going
to be able to save much toward helping Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to find ways of increasing our
volume of business,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be easy to do in a town this size,&rdquo;
replied Tom, &ldquo;and I won&rsquo;t go out and beg for
advertising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is going to ask you to,&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make the <i>Herald</i> such a bright, outstanding
paper that all of the business men will want to
advertise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the best we can,&rdquo; agreed Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s start right now by putting in a
farm page,&rdquo; suggested Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there won&rsquo;t be many farm sales from now
on,&rdquo; argued Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; conceded his sister, &ldquo;but there is haying,
threshing and then corn picking and all of the
stores have supplies to sell to the farmers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right. If you&rsquo;ll do the collecting
this afternoon, I&rsquo;ll go down to Gladbrook and
see if we can get the cooperation of the county
agent. Lots of the townships near here have farm
bureaus and I&rsquo;ll get the names of all of their
leaders and we&rsquo;ll write and tell them what we plan
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After lunch Tom teased the family flivver into
motion and set out for Gladbrook while Helen
took the sheaf of bills and started the rounds of
the business houses. She had no trouble getting
her money from all of the regular advertisers and
in every store in which she stopped she took care
to ask the owner about news of the store and of
his family. She noticed that it flattered each one
and she resolved to call on them at least once a
week.</p>
<p>Tom returned from Gladbrook late in the afternoon.
He was enthusiastic over the success of his
talk with the county agent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine chap,&rdquo; Tom explained. &ldquo;Had a
course in agricultural journalism in college and
knows news and how to write it. The Gladbrook
papers, the <i>News</i> and the <i>Times</i>, don&rsquo;t come up
in this section of the county and he&rsquo;ll be only too
glad to send us a column each week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will he start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next week will be the first one. He&rsquo;ll mail
his column every Tuesday evening and we&rsquo;ll have it
on the Wednesday morning mail. Now, here&rsquo;s
even better news. I went to several of the department
stores at Gladbrook and told them we were
going to put out a real farm page. They&rsquo;re
actually anxious to buy space and by driving down
there once a week I can get two or three good ads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will the local merchants feel?&rdquo; asked
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t object,&rdquo; replied Tom, &ldquo;for I was
careful to stress that I would only accept copy
which would not conflict with that used by our
local stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a wise thing to do,&rdquo; Helen said. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t afford to antagonize our local advertisers.
I made the rounds and collected all of the regular
accounts. There&rsquo;s only about eighteen dollars outstanding
on this month&rsquo;s bills and I&rsquo;ll get all but
about five dollars of that before the week is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to go to Cranston Friday or Saturday?&rdquo;
asked Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I surely do,&rdquo; Helen replied. &ldquo;But what for,
Tom, and can we afford it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of us will have to make the trip,&rdquo; her
brother said. &ldquo;Putting on this farm page means
we&rsquo;ll have to print two more pages at home, six
altogether, and will need only two pages of ready-print
a week from the World Printing Company.
We&rsquo;ll go down and talk with their manager at
Cranston and select the features we want for the
two pages they will continue to print for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our most important features in the ready-print
now are the comics, the serial story and the
fashion news for women,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have one page of comics,&rdquo; said
Tom, &ldquo;and fill the other page with features of
special interest to our women readers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next three days found the young Blairs so
busy getting out the current edition of the paper
that they had little time to talk about their plans.</p>
<p>They had decided to go to Cranston Friday but
when Helen found that there were special rates
for Saturday, they postponed the trip one day.
When the Friday morning mail arrived, Helen
was glad they had changed their plans. While
sorting the handful of letters, most of them circulars
destined for the wastepaper basket, she
came upon the letter she had been looking forward
to for days. The words in the upper left hand
corner thrilled her. It was from the Cranston
bureau of the Associated Press.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>With fingers that trembled slightly, she tore it
open. Would she get the job as Rolfe correspondent?
A green slip dropped out of the envelope
and Tom, who had come in from the
composing room, reached down and picked it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten dollars!&rdquo; he whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Helen, incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your check from the Associated Press for
covering the tornado,&rdquo; explained Tom. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen took the slip of crisp, green paper. She
wasn&rsquo;t dreaming. It was a check, made out in her
name and for $10.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there must be some mistake,&rdquo; she protested.
&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t mean to pay me that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think there&rsquo;s a mistake,&rdquo; grinned Tom,
&ldquo;you can go and see them when we reach Cranston
tomorrow. However, if I were you, I&rsquo;d tuck it in
my pocket, invite my brother across the street to
the drug store, and buy him a big ice cream soda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until I see what the letter says,&rdquo; replied
Helen. She pulled it out of the envelope and Tom
leaned over to read it with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Blair,&rdquo; it started, &ldquo;enclosed you will
find check for your fine work in reporting the
tornado near Rolfe. Please consider this letter as
your appointment as Rolfe correspondent for the
Associated Press. Serious accidents, fires of more
than $5,000 damage and deaths of prominent
people should be sent as soon as possible. Telegraph
or telephone, sending all your messages collect.
In using the telegraph, send messages by
press rate collect when the story is filed in the
daytime. If at night, send them night press collect.
And remember, speed counts but accuracy
must come first. Stories of a feature or time
nature should be mailed. We are counting on you
to protect us on all news that breaks in and near
Rolfe. Very truly yours, Alva McClintock, Correspondent
in charge of the Cranston Bureau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly said a lot in a few words,&rdquo; was
Tom&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re one up on me.
You&rsquo;re editor of the <i>Herald</i> and Associated Press
correspondent and I&rsquo;m only business manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get discouraged,&rdquo; laughed Helen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
let you write some of the Associated Press stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks of the compliment,&rdquo; grinned Tom.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still waiting for that ice cream soda, Miss
Plutocrat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll grumble until I buy it, I suppose, so I
might as well give in right now,&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;Come on. I&rsquo;m hungry for one myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Helen boarded the nine forty-five
Saturday morning and arrived at the state capital
shortly after noon. It was Helen&rsquo;s first trip to
Cranston and she enjoyed every minute of it, the
noise and confusion of the great railroad terminal,
the endless bobbing about of the red caps, the cries
of news boys heralding noonday editions and the
ceaseless roar of the city.</p>
<p>They went into the large restaurant at the station
for lunch and after that Tom inquired at the
information desk for directions on how to reach
the plant of the World Printing Company. He
copied the information on a slip of paper and the
two young newspaper people boarded a street car.</p>
<p>Half an hour later they were on the outskirts of
the industrial district and even before the conductor
called their stop, Tom heard the steady roar of
great presses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; he told Helen as they stepped
down from the car and looked up at a hulking ten
story building that towered above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cranston plant of the <i>Rolfe Herald</i>,&rdquo;
chuckled Helen. &ldquo;Lead on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>They walked up the steps into the office, gave
their names and indicated their business to the office
girl. After waiting a few minutes they were
ushered into an adjoining office where an energetic,
middle aged man who introduced himself as Henry
Walker, service manager, greeted them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, you&rsquo;re from the <i>Rolfe Herald</i>?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister and I are running the paper while
Dad is in the southwest regaining his health,&rdquo; explained
Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to expand the paper to
increase our advertising space and the only thing
we can see to do is cut down our ready-print to
two pages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain just what you mean,&rdquo; suggested the
service manager.</p>
<p>Tom outlined their advertising field and how
they hoped to increase business by adding two
more pages of home print, one of which would be
devoted to farm advertising and news and the
other to be available for whatever additional advertising
they could produce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be sorry to have you drop two pages
of ready-print,&rdquo; said Mr. Walker, &ldquo;but I believe
you&rsquo;re doing the right thing. Now let&rsquo;s see what
you want on the two pages you&rsquo;ll retain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Helen is editor,&rdquo; Tom explained, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s up
to her to pick out what she wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing a splendid job on the <i>Herald</i>,&rdquo;
the service manager told Helen. &ldquo;I get copies of
every paper we serve and I&rsquo;ve been noticing the
changes in make-up and the lively stories. However,
I am sorry to hear about your father but
with you two youngsters to give him pep and
courage he ought to be back on the job in a few
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sure he will,&rdquo; smiled Helen as she unfolded
a copy of their last edition of the <i>Herald</i>.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve pasted up two pages of the features I want
to retain,&rdquo; she explained as she placed them in
front of the service manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be quite
metropolitan with a full page of comics and a page
devoted to women. I&rsquo;m glad of that. Too many
editors of weeklies fail to realize that the women
and not the men are the real readers of their
papers. If you run a paper which appeals to
women and children you&rsquo;ll have a winner. Comics
for the youngsters and a serial story with a strong
love element and fashions and style news for the
women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about cost?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dropping the two pages won&rsquo;t quite cut your
bill with us in half,&rdquo; explained Mr. Walker, &ldquo;for
you&rsquo;re retaining all of our most expensive features.
However, this new plan of yours will reduce
your weekly bill about 40 per cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s satisfactory,&rdquo; agreed Tom, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;d
like to have it effective at once. Helen has written
the headings she wants for each page.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send the pages, made up in the new way,
down at the usual time next week,&rdquo; promised the
service manager, &ldquo;and when there is anything else
we can do, don&rsquo;t hesitate to let us know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were out of the building, they paused
to decide what to do next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked Mr. Walker,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t
attempt to keep us from making the change. It
means less money for his company yet he didn&rsquo;t
object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was good business on his part,&rdquo; replied Tom.
&ldquo;Now we feel kindly toward him and although he
has lost temporarily he will gain in the end for
we&rsquo;ll give him every bit of business we can in the
way of ordering supplies for job printing and
extra stock for the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we have time,&rdquo; suggested Helen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to go down to the Associated Press office.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see how
they handle all of the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They boarded the first down town street car and
got off fifteen minutes later in the heart of Cranston&rsquo;s
loop district. Across the street was the
building which housed the <i>Cranston Chronicle</i>,
the largest daily newspaper in the state. They
consulted the directory in the lobby of the building
and took the elevator to the fifth floor where the
Associated Press offices were located.</p>
<p>They stepped out of the elevator and into a large
room, filled with the clatter of many machines. A
boy, his face smeared with blue smudges off carbon
paper, rushed up to them and inquired their
business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Helen Blair, a new correspondent at
Rolfe,&rdquo; explained the editor of the <i>Herald</i>, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;d like to see Mr. McClintock, the chief correspondent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; grinned the boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him. You
wait here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngster hurried across the room to a
large table, shaped like a half moon and behind
which sat a touseled haired chap of indeterminate
age. He might be 30 and he might be 40, decided
Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to know you, Miss Blair,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
did a nice piece of work on the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. McClintock,&rdquo; replied Helen.
&ldquo;But my brother, Tom, deserves all of the credit.
He suggested calling the story to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll thank Tom, too,&rdquo; laughed the head
of the Cranston bureau of the Associated Press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here today on business for our paper,&rdquo;
explained Helen, &ldquo;and with a few minutes to spare
before train time hoped you wouldn&rsquo;t mind if we
came in and saw how the &lsquo;wheels go round&rsquo; here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be happy to show you the &lsquo;works&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied
Mr. McClintock, and he took them over to a battery
of electric printers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;bring us news from
every part of the country, east, south and far west.
In reality, they are electric typewriters controlled
from the sending station in some other city. We
take the news which comes in here, sift it out and
decide what will interest people in our own state,
and send it on to daily papers in our territory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do these electric printers run all day?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them go day and night,&rdquo; continued
Mr. McClintock, &ldquo;for the A.P. never sleeps.
Whenever news breaks, we&rsquo;ve got to be ready to
cover it. That&rsquo;s why we appreciated your calling
us on the storm. We knew there was trouble in
your part of the state but we didn&rsquo;t have a correspondent
at Rolfe. It was a mighty pleasant
surprise when you phoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They visited with the Associated Press man for
another fifteen minutes and would have continued
longer if Tom had not realized that they had less
than twenty minutes to make their train. The last
two blocks to the terminal were covered at a run
and they raced through the train gates just before
they clanged shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close call,&rdquo; panted Tom as they swung onto
the steps of the local and it slid out of the train
shed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too close,&rdquo; agreed Helen, who was breathless
from their dash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to make it, though,&rdquo; added Tom, &ldquo;or we&rsquo;d
have been stranded here flat broke with the next
train for home Monday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about something that didn&rsquo;t happen,&rdquo;
Helen said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed every minute of
our trip and we&rsquo;re all ready now to start our expansion
program for the <i>Herald</i> in earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Adding two more pages of home print to the
paper meant more work than either Tom or Helen
had realized. There was more news to be written
and more ads to be set and another run to be made
on the press.</p>
<p>With early June at hand the summer season at
the resorts on the lower end of Lake Dubar got
under way and Helen resolved to make a trip at
least once a week and run a column or two of personals
about people coming and going. She also
gave liberal space to the good roads election in
July, stressing the value the paved scenic highway
would be to Rolfe.</p>
<p>The two pages of ready-print arrived on Tuesday
and Tom and Helen were delighted with the
appearance of the comic page and the feature page
for women readers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the snappiest looking paper in the
county,&rdquo; chuckled Tom. &ldquo;Dad won&rsquo;t know the
old paper when he sees this week&rsquo;s issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The county agent kept his promise to send them
at least a column of farm news and Helen made it
a point to gather all she could while Tom went to
the county seat Tuesday morning and solicited ads
for the page. The result was a well-balanced
page, half ads and half news. Careful solicitation
of home town merchants also brought additional
ads and when they made up the last two pages
Thursday noon they felt the extra work which
increasing the size of the paper meant was more
than repaid in extra advertising.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m printing a number of extra copies this
week,&rdquo; explained Tom. &ldquo;There are lots of people
around here who ought to take the <i>Herald</i>. With
our expansion program we may pick up some extra
subscriptions and we might get a chance at the
county printing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen. &ldquo;Do you really think
we might get to be an official county paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Of course
the two Gladbrook papers will always be on the
county list but there are always three who print
the legal news and the third one is the <i>Auburn
Advocate</i>. Auburn isn&rsquo;t any larger than Rolfe
and I know darned well we have almost as many
subscriptions as they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do they decide the official papers?&rdquo; Helen
wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The county board of supervisors meets once a
year to select the three official papers,&rdquo; Tom explained,
&ldquo;and the three showing the largest circulation
are selected. It would mean at least
$2,000 extra revenue to us, most of which would
be profit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t Dad try for it?&rdquo; Helen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; said Tom slowly. &ldquo;There are
probably several reasons, the principal one being
that he wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to make the additional
effort to build up the circulation list. The
other is probably Burr Atwell, owner and publisher
of the <i>Auburn Advocate</i>. I&rsquo;ve heard Dad
often remark that Atwell is the crookedest newspaperman
in the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much circulation do you think the <i>Advocate</i>
has now?&rdquo; Helen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their last postoffice statement showed only
108 more than ours,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when do the supervisors have their annual
meeting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the 15th of December,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; smiled Helen. &ldquo;Only, when
the supervisors meet next the <i>Rolfe Herald</i> is
going to have enough circulation to be named an
official county paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Tom,&rdquo; she went on enthusiastically,
&ldquo;think what it would mean to Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of that,&rdquo; nodded her brother,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m also thinking of what Burr Atwell might
do to the <i>Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br /><i>Special Assignment</i></h2>
<p>The enlarged edition of the <i>Herald</i> attracted so
much comment and praise from the readers that
Tom and Helen felt well repaid for their additional
efforts. Tom sat down and figured out the
profit, deducted all expenses, and announced that
they had made $78 on the edition, which, they
agreed, was a figure they should strive to reach
each week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can keep that up,&rdquo; commented Tom,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be sitting on top of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we were only an official county paper
we&rsquo;d have the moon, too,&rdquo; Helen said.</p>
<p>They discussed the pros and cons of getting
enough additional circulation to beat the <i>Auburn
Advocate</i> and the danger of arousing the anger
of Burr Atwell, its publisher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to make a big campaign for subscriptions,&rdquo;
argued Helen. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve taken the biggest
step right now&mdash;improving and expanding
the amount of local and country reading matter.
Whenever I have an extra afternoon this summer
I&rsquo;ll drive out in the country and see if I can&rsquo;t get
some people who haven&rsquo;t been subscribers to take
our paper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Tom agreed with Helen&rsquo;s suggestion and that
very afternoon they took the old family touring
car, filled it with gas and oil, and ambled through
the countryside. Tom had a list of farmers who
were non-subscribers and before the afternoon
was over they had added half a dozen new names
to the <i>Herald&rsquo;s</i> circulation list. In addition, they
had obtained at least one item of farm news at
every place they stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call that a good afternoon&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; Helen
commented when they drove the ancient flivver
into the garage at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad at all,&rdquo; Tom agreed. &ldquo;Only, we&rsquo;ll
keep quiet about our circulation activities. No use
to stir up Burr Atwell until he finds it out for himself,
which will be soon enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remaining weeks of June passed uneventfully.
The days were bright and warm with the
softness of early summer and the countryside was
green with a richness that only the middle west
knows. Helen devoted the first part of each week
to getting news in Rolfe and on Fridays and
Saturdays took the old car and rambled through
the countryside, stopping at farmhouses to make
new friends for the <i>Herald</i> and gather news for
the farm page. The revenue of the paper was increasing
rapidly and they rejoiced at the encouraging
news which was coming from their father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>The Fourth of July that year came on Saturday,
which meant a two day celebration for Rolfe and
the summer resorts on Lake Dubar. Special trains
would be routed in over the railroad and the boats
on the lake would do a rushing business.</p>
<p>The managers of Crescent Beach and Sandy
Point planned big programs for their resorts and
ordered full page bills to be distributed throughout
that section of the state. The county seat papers
had usually obtained these large job printing
orders but by carefully figuring, Tom put in the
lowest bids.</p>
<p>Kirk Foster, the manager of Crescent Beach,
ordered five thousand posters while Art Provost,
the owner of Sandy Point, ordered twenty thousand.
Crescent Beach catered to a smaller and
more exclusive type of summer visitors while
Sandy Point welcomed everyone to its large and
hospitable beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>There was not much composition for the posters
but the printing required hours and it seemed to
Helen that the old press rattled continuously for
the better part of three days as Tom fed sheet
after sheet of paper into the ancient machine. The
wonder of it was that they had no breakdowns and
the bills were printed and delivered on time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of which means,&rdquo; said Tom when he had
finished, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ve added a clear profit of $65
to our bank account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we keep on at this rate,&rdquo; Helen added, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
have ample to take care of Dad when he needs
more money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll be needing it sometime this fall,&rdquo;
Tom said slowly. &ldquo;Gee whizz, but it sure does
cost to be in one of those sanitariums. Lucky we
could step in and take hold here for Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We owe him more than we&rsquo;ll ever repay,&rdquo; said
Helen, &ldquo;and the experience we&rsquo;re getting now will
be invaluable. We&rsquo;re working hard but we find
time to do the things we like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen planned special stories for the edition just
before the Fourth and visited the managers of
both resorts to get their complete programs for the
day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Kirk Foster at Crescent Beach explained that
there would be nothing unusual there except the
special display of night fireworks but Art Provost
over at Sandy Point had engaged a line of free
attractions that would rival any small circus. Besides
the usual boating and bathing, there would
be free acts by aerialists, a high dive by a girl
into a small tank of water, half a dozen clowns
to entertain the children, a free band concert both
afternoon and evening, two ball games and in addition
to the merry-go-round on the grounds there
would be a ferris wheel and several other &ldquo;thrill&rdquo;
rides brought in for the Fourth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have a great crowd,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to be mighty disappointed if I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
said the old resort manager. &ldquo;Plannin&rsquo; a regular
rip-snorter of a day. No admission to the grounds,
but Boy! it&rsquo;ll cost by the time they leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to double the prices of everything?&rdquo;
asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. Goin&rsquo; to have so many things for folks
to do they&rsquo;ll spend everything they got before they
leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;I see where I
stay at home. I&rsquo;m a notorious spendthrift when
it comes to celebrating the Fourth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say you&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo; to stay home,&rdquo;
said Mr. Provost. &ldquo;You and your mother and
Tom are goin&rsquo; to be my guests. I&rsquo;ve got your
passes all filled out. Swim, ride in the boats, dance,
roller skate, see the ball games, enjoy any of the
&lsquo;thrill rides&rsquo; you want to. Won&rsquo;t cost you a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t accept them,&rdquo; protested Helen.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pay if we come down. Besides, we didn&rsquo;t
give you all of those bills for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seemed mighty near nothin&rsquo; compared with the
prices all the other printers in the county wanted,&rdquo;
smiled Mr. Provost. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been down every
week writin&rsquo; items about the folks who come here
and, believe me, I appreciate it. These passes are
just a little return of the courtesy you&rsquo;ve shown
me this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you put it that way, I can scarcely refuse
them,&rdquo; laughed Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I wanted
them terribly for we honestly couldn&rsquo;t afford to
come otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Helen returned to the office she told Tom
about the passes and he agreed that acceptance of
them would not place the <i>Herald</i> under obligation
to the resort owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought old man Provost a pretty
good scout,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I hardly expected him
to do this. And say, these passes are good for
both Saturday and Sunday. What a break!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we see everything Saturday we&rsquo;ll be so tired
we won&rsquo;t want to go back Sunday,&rdquo; Helen said.
&ldquo;Besides, Mother has some pretty strong ideas on
Sunday celebrations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone rang and Helen hastened into the
editorial office to answer.</p>
<p>She talked rapidly for several minutes, jotting
down notes on a pad of scratch paper. When she
had finished, she hurried back into the composing
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that was Mr. Provost calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he cancel the passes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not. He called to say he had just
received a telegram from the Ace Flying Circus
saying it would be at Sandy Point to do stunt flying
and carry passengers for the Fourth of July
celebration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so excited about that? We&rsquo;ve had flying
circuses here before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, Tom, but &lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand is in
charge of the Ace outfit this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand!&rdquo; whistled Tom. &ldquo;Well, I
should say that was different. That&rsquo;s news. Why
Rand&rsquo;s the man who flew from Tokyo to Seattle
all alone. Other fellows had done it in teams but
Rand is the only one to go solo. He&rsquo;s big news
in all of the dailies right now. Everyone is wondering
what daredevil stunt he&rsquo;ll do next.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very good looking and awfully rich,&rdquo;
smiled Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flies just for fun,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;With all
of the oil land he&rsquo;s got he doesn&rsquo;t have to worry
about work. Tell you what, I&rsquo;ll write to the
<i>Cranston Chronicle</i> and see if they&rsquo;ll send us a
cut of Rand. It would look fine on the front page
of this week&rsquo;s issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed Helen &ldquo;I almost forgot the
most important part of Mr. Provost&rsquo;s call. He
wants you to get out 10,000 half page bills on the
Ace Flying Circus. Here are the notes. He said
for you to write the bill and run them off as soon
as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order for the bills put Tom behind on his
work with the paper and it was late Thursday
afternoon before Helen started folding that week&rsquo;s
issue. But they didn&rsquo;t mind being late. The bill
order from Sandy Point had meant another piece
of profitable job work and Mr. Provost had also
taken a half page in the <i>Herald</i> to advertise the
coming of his main attraction for the Fourth.
Mrs. Blair came down to help with the folding
and Margaret Stevens, just back from a vacation
in the north woods with her father, arrived in time
to lend a hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nice trip?&rdquo; Helen asked as she deftly folded
the printed sheets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; smiled Margaret, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m glad
to get back. I missed helping you and Tom.
Honestly, I get a terrific thrill out of reporting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad to have you back,&rdquo; replied Helen,
&ldquo;and I think Mr. Provost down at Sandy Point
will be glad to give me an extra pass for the
Fourth. I&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;re our star reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go to Crescent Beach for the
Fourth,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s newer and much
more ritzy than Sandy Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stop and look at the front page
carefully,&rdquo; warned Tom, who had shut off the
press just in time to hear Margaret&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>She stopped folding papers long enough to read
the type under the two column picture on the front
page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;&lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand coming
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None other and none such,&rdquo; laughed Tom.
&ldquo;Guaranteed to be the one and only &lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand.
Step right this way folks for your airplane tickets.
Five dollars for five minutes. See the beauty of
Lake Dubar from the air. Don&rsquo;t crowd, please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still want me to get a pass?&rdquo; Helen
asked. &ldquo;It will be honored any place at Sandy
Point during the celebration and Mr. Provost says
we can all have rides with the air circus &lsquo;Speed&rsquo;
Rand is running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say I do want a pass,&rdquo; said Margaret.
&ldquo;At least it&rsquo;s some advantage to being a newspaper
woman besides just the fun of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The famous Ace air circus of half a dozen
planes roared over Rolfe just before sunset Friday
night and the whole town turned out to see them
and try to identify the plane which &ldquo;Speed&rdquo; Rand
was flying.</p>
<p>The air circus was flying in two sections, three
fast, trim little biplanes that led the way, followed
by three large cabin planes used for passenger
carrying. Every ship was painted a brilliant
scarlet and they looked like tongues of flames darting
through the sky, the afternoon sun glinting on
their wings.</p>
<p>The air circus swung over Rolfe in a wide circle
and the leading plane dropped down out of the
sky, its motor roaring so loud the windows in the
houses rattled in their frames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to crash!&rdquo; cried Margaret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; shouted Tom, who had
read widely of planes and pilots and flying maneuvers.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a power dive&mdash;fancy flying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom was right. When the scarlet biplane
seemed headed for certain destruction the pilot
pulled its nose up, levelled off, shot over Rolfe at
dizzying speed and then climbed his craft back toward
the fleecy, lazy white clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Rand,&rdquo; announced Tom with a certainty
that left no room for argument. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always
up to stunts like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be awfully dangerous,&rdquo; said Helen as
she watched the plane, now a mere speck in the
sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;Everything depends on
the motor in a dive like that. If it started to miss
some editor would have to write that particular
flyer&rsquo;s obituary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning of Saturday, the Fourth, dawned
clear and bright. Small boys whose idea of fun
was to arise at four o&rsquo;clock and spend the next two
hours throwing cannon crackers under windows
had their usual good time and Tom and Helen, unable
to sleep, were up at six o&rsquo;clock. Half an hour
later Margaret Stevens, also awakened by the
almost continuous cannonading of firecrackers,
came across the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jim Preston is going to take us down the lake
on his seven-thirty trip before the special trains
and the big crowds start coming in,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like to see the trains come in,&rdquo; protested
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we wait until then,&rdquo; explained Tom, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
be caught in the thick of the rush for the boats
and we may never get to Sandy Point. We&rsquo;d
better take the seven-thirty boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the hill on which the Blair home stood
they looked down on the shore of Lake Dubar
with its half dozen boat landings, each with two
or three motorboats awaiting the arrival of the
first special excursion train.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair called them to breakfast and they
were getting up to go inside when Margaret&rsquo;s exclamation
drew their attention back to the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I seeing things or is that the old <i>Queen</i>?&rdquo;
she asked, pointing down the lake.</p>
<p>Tom and Helen looked in the direction she
pointed. An old, double decked boat, smoke rolling
from its lofty, twin funnels, was churning its
way up the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We may all be seeing things,&rdquo; cried Tom, &ldquo;but
it looks like the <i>Queen</i>. I thought she had been
condemned by the steamboat inspectors as unfit
for further service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news that &lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand is going to be at
Sandy Point is bringing hundreds more than the
railroad expected,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I talked with
the station agent last night and they have four
specials scheduled in this morning and they usually
only have two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they vote the paved roads at the special election
next week,&rdquo; commented Tom, &ldquo;the railroad
will lose a lot of summer travel. As it is now,
folks almost have to come by train for the slightest
rain turns the roads around here into swamps and
they can&rsquo;t run the risk of being marooned here for
several days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Queen</i> puffed sedately toward shore. They
heard the clang of bells in the engine room and
the steady chouf-chouf of the exhaust cease. The
smoke drifted lazily from the funnels. Bells
clanged again and the paddle wheel at the stern
went into the back motion, churning the water
into white froth. The forward speed of the <i>Queen</i>
was checked and the big double-decker nosed into
its pier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s old Capt. Billy Tucker sticking his
white head out of the pilot house,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably put a few new planks in the
<i>Queen&rsquo;s</i> rotten old hull and gotten another O. K.
from the boat inspectors. But if that old tub ever
hits anything, the whole bottom will cave in and
she&rsquo;ll sink in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a very cheerful Fourth of July
idea,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s eat. Your
mother called us hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had finished breakfast and were leaving
the table when Mrs. Blair spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided not to go down to Sandy Point
with you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The crowd will be so large
I&rsquo;m afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy it very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve planned on your going, Mother,&rdquo;
said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to disappoint you,&rdquo; smiled her
mother, &ldquo;but Margaret&rsquo;s mother and I will spend
the day on the hill here. We&rsquo;ll be able to see the
aerial circus perform and really we&rsquo;ll enjoy a quiet
day here at home more than being in the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be very quiet if those kids keep on
shooting giant crackers,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be going to the celebration in another
hour or two and then things will quiet down,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Blair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about a plane ride if the circus has time
to take us?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>Helen saw her mother tremble at Tom&rsquo;s question,
but she replied quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to you, Tom. You know more about
planes than I do and if you&rsquo;re convinced the flying
circus is safe, I have no objection.&rdquo; But Helen
made a mental reservation that the planes would
have to look mighty safe before any of them went
aloft.</p>
<p>They hurried down the hill to the pier which
Jim Preston used. The boatman and his helpers
had just finished polishing the three speed boats
Preston owned, the <i>Argosy</i>, the <i>Liberty</i> and the
<i>Flyer</i>, which had been raised from the bottom of
the lake and partially rebuilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready for the big day?&rdquo; asked the genial
boatman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re shy a few hours sleep,&rdquo; grinned Tom.
&ldquo;Those cannon crackers started about four o&rsquo;clock
but outside of that we&rsquo;re all pepped up and ready
to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About three or four years ago,&rdquo; reminded the
boatman, &ldquo;you used to be gallivantin&rsquo; around town
with a pocketful of those big, red crackers at sun-up.
Guess you can&rsquo;t complain a whole lot now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Tom admitted that he really couldn&rsquo;t complain
and they climbed into the <i>Liberty</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; some last minute supplies down
to the hotel at Sandy Point,&rdquo; said the boatman, &ldquo;so
we won&rsquo;t wait for anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He switched on the starter and the boat quivered
as the powerful motor took hold. They were backing
away from the pier when the pilot of one of
the other boats shouted for them to stop.</p>
<p>A boy was running down Main Street, waving a
yellow envelope in his hand.</p>
<p>Jim Preston nosed the <i>Liberty</i> back to the pier
and the boy ran onto the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telegram for you,&rdquo; he told Helen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
rush message and I just had to get it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot,&rdquo; replied Helen. &ldquo;Are there
any charges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. Message is prepaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen ripped open the envelope with nervous
fingers. Who could be sending her a telegram?
Was there anything wrong with her father? No,
that couldn&rsquo;t be it for her mother would have received
the message.</p>
<p>She unfolded the single sheet of yellow paper
and read the telegraph operator&rsquo;s bold scrawl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To: Helen Blair, <i>The Herald</i>, Rolfe. Understand
&lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand is at Rolfe for two days.
Have rumor his next flight will be an attempted
non-stop refueling flight around the world. See
Rand at once and try for confirmation of rumor.
Telephone as soon as possible. McClintock, The
AP.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen turned to Tom and Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to interview &lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand for the Associated
Press,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br /><i>Helen&rsquo;s Exclusive Story</i></h2>
<p>While the <i>Liberty</i> whisked them through the
glistening waters of Lake Dubar toward Sandy
Point, Margaret and Tom plied Helen with questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Rand will give you an interview?&rdquo;
demanded Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get one,&rdquo; said Helen, her face
flushed and eyes glowing with the excitement of
her first big assignment for the Associated Press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you ask him? How will you act?&rdquo;
Margaret wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t try to get me flustered before I
see Rand,&rdquo; laughed Helen. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll just explain
that I am the local correspondent for the
Associated Press, show him the telegram from
Mr. McClintock and ask him to confirm or deny
the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet Rand&rsquo;s been interviewed by every
famous reporter in the country,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which will mean all the more honor and glory
for Helen if she can get him to tell about his
plans,&rdquo; said Margaret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; promised Helen and her lips
set in a line that indicated the Blair fighting spirit
was on the job.</p>
<p>They were still more than two miles from Sandy
Point when a scarlet-hued plane shot into sight
and climbed dizzily toward the clouds. It spiralled
up and up, the roar of its motor audible even
above the noise of the speedboat&rsquo;s engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s &lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand now!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;No
one flies like that but &lsquo;Speed&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The graceful little plane reached the zenith of
its climb, turned over on its back and fell away
in twisting series of spirals that held the little
group in the boat breathless.</p>
<p>The plane fluttered toward the lake, seemingly
without life or power. Just before it appeared
about to crash, the propeller fanned the sunlight,
the nose jerked up, and the little ship skimmed over
the waters of the lake.</p>
<p>It was coming toward the <i>Liberty</i> at 200 miles
an hour. On and on it came until the roar of its
motor drowned out every other sound. Helen,
Tom and Margaret threw themselves onto the
floor of the boat and Jim Preston crouched low
behind his steering wheel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>There was a sharp crash and Helen held her
breath. She was sure the plane had struck the
<i>Liberty</i> but the boat moved steadily ahead and
she turned quickly to look for the plane.</p>
<p>The scarlet sky bird was limping toward the
safety of the higher altitudes, its under-carriage
twisted into a grotesque knot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; cried Tom as he stared
aghast at &lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand&rsquo;s damaged plane. &ldquo;Did
we get hit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing wrong with the <i>Liberty</i>,&rdquo; announced
Jim Preston. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen glanced at the speedboat&rsquo;s wake where
a heavy wave was being rolled up by the powerful
propeller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what happened,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;&lsquo;Rand&rsquo;
was just trying to give us an extra Fourth of July
thrill and he forgot about the heavy wave the
<i>Liberty</i> pulls. He must have banged his landing
gear into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Helen,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;But I
can&rsquo;t figure out why he didn&rsquo;t nose over and dive
to the bottom of the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect that would have happened to any
flyer except Rand,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s supposed
to be a wizard in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how this accident will affect the crowd
at Sandy Point. Think it will keep them from
riding with the air circus?&rdquo; Margaret asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depends on how widely the story gets out,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to have Old Man Provost&rsquo;s
celebration ruined by wild rumors. He&rsquo;s spent a
lot of money getting ready to give the public a
good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen had been watching the progress of Rand&rsquo;s
plane. Instead of heading back toward Sandy
Point he was crossing the lake to the east side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not going back to Sandy Point,&rdquo; Helen
cried. &ldquo;Look, he&rsquo;s going to land on the east side
back in the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll leave the plane there and no one at
Sandy Point will know anything about the accident,&rdquo;
exclaimed Tom. &ldquo;That means we&rsquo;re the
only ones who know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen was thinking rapidly. Here was just the
chance she needed to get hold of Rand and ask him
about his world trip. She might be able to make
a trade with him. It was worth a try. She leaned
forward and spoke to the boatman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you swing over east, land and pick up the
pilot of that plane?&rdquo; she asked Jim Preston.</p>
<p>Tom, divining the motive back of Helen&rsquo;s request,
added, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pay for the extra time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>The boatman agreed and the nose of the <i>Liberty</i>
was soon cleaving a white-crested path for the
east shore. The scarlet plane had disappeared
but from the drone of the motor they knew it was
somewhere in the hills back from the lakeshore.</p>
<p>Jim Preston let the <i>Liberty</i> drift to an easy landing
alongside a rocky outcropping and Tom, Helen
and Margaret hopped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be gone long,&rdquo; they promised.</p>
<p>Back through the sparse timber along the lake
shore they hurried and out into a long, narrow
meadow. The scene that greeted them held them
spellbound for a moment. Then they raced
toward the far end of the pasture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speed&rdquo; Rand had landed the damaged plane
in a fence.</p>
<p>Tom was the first to reach the wrecked craft.
He expected to find the famous flyer half dead
in the wreckage. Instead, he was greeted by a
debonair young fellow who crawled from beneath
one wing where he had been tossed by the impact
when the plane struck the fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gosh,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; smiled Rand, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll have to disappoint
you. I haven&rsquo;t anything more than a few
bruises.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Helen and Margaret arrived so out of breath
they were speechless.</p>
<p>Rand bowed slightly. Then his eyes glowed
with recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the folks in the
speedboat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure were,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;You scared us
half to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scared myself,&rdquo; admitted Rand, his blue eyes
reflecting the laughter on his lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so
long since I&rsquo;ve been in a speedboat I&rsquo;d forgotten
all about the big wake one of those babies pull.
I&rsquo;m just lucky not to be at the bottom of the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really &lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked
Margaret.</p>
<p>He smiled and nodded and Margaret decided
she had never seen a more likable young man.
His hair was brown and curly and his face was
bronzed by the sun of many continents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got your boat around here, suppose
you give me a lift back to Sandy Point,&rdquo; suggested
Rand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to,&rdquo; Helen replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
suppose you&rsquo;ll want it broadcast about the accident
this morning on the lake and your cracking up
in a fence over here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you driving at? Trying to hi-jack
me into paying you to keep quiet?&rdquo; The last words
were short and angry and his eyes hardened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like that,&rdquo; explained Tom quickly.
&ldquo;We know that broadcasting news of an accident
to &lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand will hurt Old Man Provost and
his celebration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do you want?&rdquo; Rand insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to know whether there is anything
to the rumor that you&rsquo;re considering a non-stop
refueling flight around the world,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>Rand stopped and stared at the young editor
of the <i>Herald</i> in open amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You sound
like a newspaper reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Helen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the editor of the
<i>Rolfe Herald</i> and also correspondent for the Associated
Press.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want a story from me about my world
flight in return for keeping quiet about the accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can call it that,&rdquo; admitted Helen.</p>
<p>They had reached the shore of the lake and
Rand did not answer until they were in the <i>Liberty</i>
and Jim Preston had the craft headed for Sandy
Point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I deny the rumor,&rdquo; said Rand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already admitted it,&rdquo; Helen replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have?&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less than five minutes ago you said &lsquo;And you
want a story about my world flight in return for
keeping quiet about the accident?&rsquo; That certainly
indicates that you are seriously considering such
a project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand laughed and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I might as well give in,&rdquo; he chuckled.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been questioned in every city I&rsquo;ve been in
and so far I&rsquo;ve managed to evade confirming the
rumor but it looks like you&rsquo;ve got me in a corner.
If I don&rsquo;t tell you, will you still spread the story
about the accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Helen quickly. &ldquo;Mr. Provost has
too much at stake to risk ruining his celebration.
It was foolish on your part to take the risk you
did and we&rsquo;re trusting that there won&rsquo;t be any
more such risks taken by the air circus while it
is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. There won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; said Rand
firmly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve learned a lesson myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually planning the world flight?&rdquo;
asked Tom, who wanted to get Rand back on the
subject of Helen&rsquo;s assignment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get away from you,&rdquo; smiled the flyer,
&ldquo;so I might as well give you all of the details. Got
some copypaper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen fished a pad of paper and a pencil from
a pocket and handed them to Rand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll jot down
the principal names of the foreign towns where
I&rsquo;ll make the refueling contacts. Some of them
have queer names and it will help you keep them
straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flyer drew a rough sketch of the world,
outlining the continents of the northern hemisphere.
He located New York on the map and
then drew a dotted line extending eastward across
the North Atlantic, over Great Britain, Germany,
Russia, Siberia, a corner of China, out over the
Kamchatka peninsula, across the Bering Sea, over
Alaska and then almost a straight line back to
New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my proposed route,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;covering some 15,000 miles. It will take about
four days if I have good luck and am not forced
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought the distance around the world
was 25,000 miles,&rdquo; said Margaret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the circumference at the equator,&rdquo;
smiled Rand, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to make the trip well
up in the northern latitudes. In fact, I&rsquo;ll be pretty
close to the Arctic circle part of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand bent over his makeshift map again, marking
in the names of the cities where he intended
to refuel while in flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you take off from New York?&rdquo;
Helen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In about two weeks,&rdquo; replied Rand without
looking up from the map.</p>
<p>Helen gasped. This, indeed, was news. Every
paper in the land would carry it on the front page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a plane do you intend to use?&rdquo;
Tom wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having one built to order,&rdquo; said the flyer.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a special monoplane the Skycraft Company
is testing now at their factory in Pennsylvania. I
had a telegram yesterday saying the plane would
be ready the first of next week so when I leave
Sandy Point I&rsquo;ll go directly to Pennsylvania to
get the plane and make the final tests myself. The
air circus will finish its summer tour alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they reached the landing at Sandy Point,
Rand explained how he intended to refuel while
in flight, gave Helen the name of his mechanic and
described details of the plane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>When they touched the landing at Sandy Point
a heavyset man dressed in brown coveralls jumped
into the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in heaven&rsquo;s name happened?&rdquo; he asked
Rand excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I flew too close to this motor boat,&rdquo; said the
flyer, &ldquo;and damaged my landing gear on the wave
it was pulling. Instead of coming back here to
crack up I went across the lake and landed in a
meadow. These young people followed and
brought me back. I banged the ship up considerable
and in return for keeping them quiet, I gave
them the story about my world flight. They&rsquo;re
newspaper folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heavy man stared at Helen, Tom and
Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess it had to come out some time,&rdquo;
he admitted and Rand introduced him as Tiny
Adams, his manager of the air circus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiny runs the show when I go gallivanting
around on some fool stunt,&rdquo; explained Rand.</p>
<p>Even at that early hour the crowd was gathering
at Sandy Point. Motor boats were whisking down
the lake from Rolfe and the beautiful beach
was thick with bathers in for a morning dip in the
clear waters of the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>They hurried off the boat dock and pushed their
way through the crowd along the lake shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the hotel and telephone my story
to the Associated Press,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;And
thanks so much, Mr. Rand, for confirming it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; grinned the famous flyer.
&ldquo;I guess you youngsters deserve the break. You
certainly were after the news and I appreciate
you&rsquo;re keeping quiet about my accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to print it in our weekly,&rdquo; warned
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Rand. &ldquo;The celebration
will be over long before your paper comes
out. See you at the field later,&rdquo; he added as he
hurried away, followed by the manager of the air
circus.</p>
<p>Helen stood for a moment looking after the tall
flyer as he edged his way through the ever-increasing
crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he handsome?&rdquo; sighed Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a story,&rdquo; commented Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get going,&rdquo; said Helen, and she started
for the hotel.</p>
<p>They reached the rambling old hotel which overlooked
the lake and were met at the door by Art
Provost, the manager of the resort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you down so early,&rdquo; he said as he
welcomed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we&rsquo;d get here before the crowd,&rdquo;
Tom said, &ldquo;but from the looks of the young mob
down at the beach now they must have started
coming in about sundown last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did,&rdquo; chuckled Mr. Provost. &ldquo;Looks
like the greatest celebration in the history of Lake
Dubar. It&rsquo;s the air circus that&rsquo;s drawing them
in and I hope there are no accidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen glanced at Tom, warning her brother not
to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met &lsquo;Speed&rsquo; Rand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I think
you&rsquo;ll find him a careful flyer. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll
insist on every possible precaution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went into the lobby of the hotel and Helen
entered the telephone booth. She started to put
in a long distance call for the Associated Press,
then changed her mind and returned to where Tom
and Margaret were waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so nervous I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t be able to
talk,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Feel my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Margaret did as Helen directed. They
found her hands clammy with perspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll sit down and write the story and
telegraph it,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; insisted Tom.
&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll put the call through and you just repeat
what Rand told you. They&rsquo;ll write the story
at the Cranston bureau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen nodded in agreement and Tom bolted into
the telephone booth, got the long distance operator
at Rolfe and put in a collect call for the Cranston
bureau of the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Two minutes later Tom announced that the
A.P. was on the line. Helen entered the booth
and took the receiver. Tom pulled the door shut
and Helen was closeted with her big story in the
tiny room, the mouthpiece before her connecting
her with the bureau where they were waiting for
the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. McClintock in the office?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s busy,&rdquo; replied the voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the
message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Mr. McClintock that Helen Blair is calling
about the Rand story,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>She heard the connection switch and the chief
of the Cranston bureau snapped a question at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Rand give
you the usual denial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sharpness of the words nettled Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;He gave me the
whole story. He&rsquo;ll leave New York within the
next two weeks on a non-stop refueling flight
around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; shouted the A.P. chief.</p>
<p>Helen repeated her statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the biggest story in days,&rdquo; gasped
McClintock. &ldquo;Have you got plenty of substantiation
in case he tries to deny it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two witnesses,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;and a map of
his route which he drew and signed for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough. Let&rsquo;s go. Give me everything
he told you. Spell the names of his foreign refueling
points slowly. I&rsquo;ll take it directly on a
typewriter and we&rsquo;ll start the bulletins out on the
main news wires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first excitement of the story worn off,
Helen found herself exceedingly calm. In short,
clear sentences she related for McClintock all of
the information &ldquo;Speed&rdquo; Rand had given her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send me the map he drew by the first mail,&rdquo;
the A.P. correspondent instructed. &ldquo;It will make
a great feature story. Thanks a lot, Miss Blair.
You&rsquo;re a real newspaperwoman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br /><i>The Queen&rsquo;s Last Trip</i></h2>
<p>When Helen left the close confines of the telephone
booth after completing her call to the Associated
Press she suddenly felt very weak and
tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel just a little faint,&rdquo; confessed Helen.
&ldquo;Guess the excitement of getting the story and
sending it in was a little too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my arm,&rdquo; her brother commanded.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back to the restaurant and get a glass
of milk and a sandwich and you&rsquo;ll feel all right
in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The food restored Helen&rsquo;s strength and in less
than half an hour she was her old self, ready to
enjoy the Fourth of July celebration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Every boat from Rolfe increased the size of the
crowd at Sandy Point. The speedboats dashed
down the lake carrying their capacity of passengers,
turned and sped back to the town for another
load. The <i>Queen</i> sedately churned its way through
the lake, its double decks jammed with humanity.
As they stood on the beach Helen wondered if the
old lake boat would come through the day without
a mishap. Almost any small accident could
throw the passengers into a panic and the capsizing
of the <i>Queen</i> might follow if they rushed to
one side of the flat-bottomed old craft.</p>
<p>The <i>Queen</i> sidled up to the big pier at Sandy
Beach and Capt. Billy Tucker stuck his white head
out of a window in the pilot house and watched
his passengers rush for the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in his glory on a day like this,&rdquo; Tom said,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s probably the last year for the <i>Queen</i>. The
boat inspectors won&rsquo;t dare pass the old tub next
year no matter how much they like Captain Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will he do if they don&rsquo;t license the
<i>Queen</i>?&rdquo; asked Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll get along all right,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Captain
Billy has plenty salted away. It&rsquo;s just that
he loves the lake and the <i>Queen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The planes of the air circus were wheeling overhead
and they left the beach and started for the
air field. The attractions along the midway were
gathering their share of the crowd and the mechanical
band on the merry-go-round blared with
great gusto. The ferris wheel was swinging cars
loaded with celebrators into the tree-tops and the
whip and other thrill rides were crowded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Beyond the midway was the large pasture which
had been turned into a landing field. A sturdy
wire fence had been thrown across the side toward
the summer resort and it was necessary to have a
pass or ticket to get through the gate.</p>
<p>Two small stunt planes were taking off when
the members of the <i>Herald</i> staff arrived and the
three large cabin planes were being filled with
passengers. Two of the planes carried eight passengers
apiece while the largest, a tri-motor, could
accommodate 12. They were sturdy, comfortable
looking craft and Helen noticed that they appeared
to be in the best possible condition.</p>
<p>They presented their passes at the gate and
were admitted to the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speed&rdquo; Rand, hurrying along toward the
largest plane, caught sight of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to ride?&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>The answer was unanimous and affirmative.</p>
<p>A minute later they were seated in the 12-passenger
plane in comfortable wicker chairs. The
door was closed, the motors roared, they bumped
over the pasture and then floated away on magic
wings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>The ground dropped away from them; the resort
and the lake were miniatures bordered by the
rich, green lands of the valley and at the far end
of the lake, Rolfe, a handful of houses, basked.</p>
<p>It was glorious, thrilling, and Helen enjoyed
every minute. They swung over the lake where
the speedboats were cutting white swaths through
the water. They did not cross to the east side
and Helen guessed that the pilots were afraid
some passenger with unusually keen eyes might
detect the remains of the plane Rand had damaged
that morning.</p>
<p>Then the trip was over. They drifted down
to the field, the motor idling as they lost altitude.
Helen sat absolutely rigid for a few seconds,
wondering if the plane would land all right. The
motors roared again, the nose came up and they
settled to earth with little more than a bump.</p>
<p>Rand greeted them when they stepped out of
the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; said Tom enthusiastically. &ldquo;Biggest
thrill I ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you?&rdquo; Rand asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved every minute until we started to come
down,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;Then I wondered where we
were going to stop and how, but everything came
out all right and I really did enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get your story in to the A.P.?&rdquo; asked the
flyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as I could reach a telephone,&rdquo;
Helen replied. &ldquo;The bureau chief appeared
pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should be,&rdquo; chuckled Rand. &ldquo;It seems like
every place I&rsquo;ve gone for the last month there&rsquo;s
been a reporter waiting to ask me questions about
my world flight. Honestly, it got so I used to look
under the bed at night for fear I might talk in my
sleep and wake up in the morning to find a reporter
had been hidden in my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another flyer called Rand and the famous aviator
slipped away through the crowd. It was the
last they were to see of him and they turned and
went back to the attractions of the midway.</p>
<p>They tried every ride, the merry-go-round and
the ferris wheel, roller skated, went bathing,
listened to the band concert, munched hot dogs
at irregular intervals and wound up the afternoon
almost exhausted and ready to start for home.
So were some other hundreds of people and they
found it impossible to get a place in one of the
speedboats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>The <i>Queen</i> puffed majestically at her pier and
Capt. Billy Tucker pulled twice on the whistle
cord. Two long, mellow blasts echoed over the
lake. The <i>Queen</i> would leave for Rolfe in five
minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;ll have to take the <i>Queen</i> if we
want to get home in any reasonable time,&rdquo; said
Margaret.</p>
<p>Tom looked at the throngs waiting for the boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be able
to get on one of the fast boats for at least two
hours and I&rsquo;m getting hungry. I saw mother
putting some pie away in the ice box last night
and there&rsquo;ll be plenty of cold milk at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; protested Helen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hungry now
I&rsquo;m hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s take the <i>Queen</i>,&rdquo; urged Margaret.</p>
<p>They bought their tickets and hurried onto the
main deck of the old lake boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be cooler on top,&rdquo; said Helen and they
went up the broad stairs to the upper deck.
Perched on this deck was the pilot house where
Captain Billy ruled.</p>
<p>He saw them and motioned them to join him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a big celebration?&rdquo; he asked when they
entered the pilot house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finest ever,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re ready
to call it a day and start home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better set down on those benches,&rdquo; said Captain
Billy, motioning toward the leather-cushioned
lockers which lined the walls of the pilot house.</p>
<p>The veteran lake skipper leaned out of the pilot
house, watching the crowd on the beach. The
electric lights flashed on as twilight draped its
purple mantle over the lake and the whole scene
was subdued. The cries from the bathers were
not as sharp, the music from the midway seemed
to have lost some of its sharpness and the whole
crowd of holiday celebrators relaxed with the coming
of night.</p>
<p>Captain Billy glanced at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two minutes,&rdquo; he said, half to himself as he
reached for the whistle cord. Again the mellow
whistle of the <i>Queen</i> rang out and belated excursionists
hastened aboard.</p>
<p>The ticket seller at the pier head sounded his
final warning bell, and there was the last minute
rush across the stubby gang plank. Captain Billy
signalled the engine room, bells rang in the depths
of the boat and the easy chouf-chouf of the twin
stacks deepened as the engines took up their work
and the <i>Queen</i> backed slowly away from the pier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Two men who had tarried at the midway too
long ran down the pier and yelled at Captain
Billy. The skipper picked up his megaphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, too late,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back
in two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh-dinged idiots,&rdquo; he grumbled to himself.
&ldquo;Here I wait as long as I can and then they expect
me to put back in shore. Not me, by Joe, when
I&rsquo;ve got to make connections with one of them
excursion trains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have lots of business today?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biggest day in the twenty odd years I&rsquo;ve had
the <i>Queen</i> on the lake,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;The old
girl is about on her last legs but this season looks
like the best of all. If the paved road goes through
they&rsquo;ll all come in cars and the railroad and the
<i>Queen</i> will be out of luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not objecting to the paved road,
are you?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course not,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s progress and
you can&rsquo;t stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Queen</i>, ablaze with lights, churned steadily
up the lake and the electrics along the beach at
Sandy Point faded into a string of dots. Speed
boats, showing their red and green riding lights,
raced past in smothers of foam but the <i>Queen</i>
rocked only slightly as they passed and continued
steadily on her way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>The band on the after part of the top deck played
slower, softer melodies and the whole scene was
one of calm and quiet, a fitting end for a great
celebration.</p>
<p>Of all the people on the <i>Queen</i>, only Captain
Billy in the pilot house and the crew in the black
depths of the engine room were alive to the
dangers of the night. They knew how anything
unusual and startling might cause a panic which
would capsize the <i>Queen</i> or how careless navigation
on the part of Captain Billy might shove the
<i>Queen</i> onto one of the jagged ledges of rock which
were hazards to navigation in certain parts of the
lake. But the <i>Queen</i> passed safely through the
rock-strewn sections of the lake and Captain Billy
relaxed as the lights of Rolfe came into view.</p>
<p>The <i>Queen</i> was less than half a mile from her
pier when the unexpected happened. A speed boat,
without lights, loomed out of the night.</p>
<p>Screams echoed from the lower deck. Before
Captain Billy could twirl his wheel and shift the
blunt nose of the <i>Queen</i>, the speed boat knifed
into the bow of the old steamer.</p>
<p>There was the crash of splintering wood, and
muffled cries from the men and women in the
smaller boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Captain Billy knew the danger even before the
boats met. The crash of the collision was still in
their ears when he called to Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the wheel,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and keep the <i>Queen</i>
headed for the beach. Don&rsquo;t change the course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he leaned over the speaking tube to the
engine room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Billy speaking,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;A speed
boat just hit us. Full speed ahead until we ground
on the sandy beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could feel the <i>Queen</i> trembling as the
crowd on the lower deck rushed forward toward
the scene of the accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fools, the fools,&rdquo; muttered Captain Billy
as he ran from the pilot house.</p>
<p>The leader of the band ran forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back and play,&rdquo; ordered the captain. &ldquo;Play
anything loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deck hand, racing up from below, met Captain
Billy at the head of the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They knocked a hole clear through us,&rdquo; he
gasped. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking water fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; snapped the captain. &ldquo;Stay here
and don&rsquo;t let anyone off the upper deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young people in the pilot house saw Captain
Billy rush down the stairs and they looked at one
another in open amazement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s every inch a skipper,&rdquo; said Tom as he
clung to the wheel of the <i>Queen</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he pulls us through,&rdquo; said Margaret,
staring at the lights of Rolfe. A minute ago they
had seemed so close; now they were so far
away, the longest half mile any of them would ever
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get us there if it is humanly possible,&rdquo;
Helen said hopefully.</p>
<p>The crowd on the upper deck milled excitedly
but the deck hand forced them back from the stairway
and the steady playing of the band and continued
forward movement of the <i>Queen</i> seemed
to allay their worst fears.</p>
<p>Sparks rolled from the twin funnels as the
engines labored to the utmost but Tom, his hands
on the sensitive wheel, knew that the speed was
decreasing. The <i>Queen</i> was harder to handle,
the bow was settling lower in the water but less
than a quarter of a mile remained. He reached
up and pulled the whistle cord. Three short, sharp
blasts shattered the night. Three more and then
three more. It was the signal for help but he
wondered how many would be in Rolfe to answer
the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How deep is the water from here in?&rdquo; asked
Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty feet,&rdquo; replied her brother.
&ldquo;Better slip on those life preservers and get ready
to jump. We&rsquo;re taking water fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several hundred in the lockers here,&rdquo;
said Helen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pass them out to the
people on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will only alarm them,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve got to have a chance if we go
under,&rdquo; replied Helen and with Margaret to help
her, she hurled scores of life preservers out of the
pilot house onto the deck.</p>
<p>The passengers had lost their first panic. They
knew the <i>Queen</i> was making a valiant fight to
reach shore but the tenseness, the grimness of
the crew told them it was going to be close. In
the emergency they used their heads and put on
the life preservers as fast as Helen and Margaret
could pull them from the lockers.</p>
<p>The lights of Rolfe were agonizingly close.
Less than six hundred feet separated them from
the safety of the sandy shore. On the upper deck
the passengers were quiet, ready for the crisis.</p>
<p>Tom leaned close to the speaking tube. The
chief engineer was talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he saying?&rdquo; Helen demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Water&rsquo;s in the engine room,&rdquo; replied her
brother. &ldquo;The fires under the boiler will be out
in another minute or two. Then blewy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there enough steam to make shore?&rdquo;
asked Margaret desperately, for after her experience
on the lake earlier in the summer she had
a very real fear of Dubar at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we can do is hope,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
keep the engines turning over as long as there is
any steam left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warning from the whistle was bringing
people from town and they were gathering under
the electrics along the beach. Helen wondered if
they knew that death was riding on the bow of
the <i>Queen</i>, that tragedy was waiting to swoop
down on the old boat and its load of excursionists.</p>
<p>The <i>Queen</i> staggered, wabbled dangerously,
and the wheel jerked out of Tom&rsquo;s hands. He
grabbed the spokes and held the bow steady as the
<i>Queen</i> stumbled ahead. They could see the faces
of the people on the beach now, saw the look of
horror that spread over them as they saw the
stove-in bow of the <i>Queen</i>. There were only two
hundred feet to go but they were still in deep
water.</p>
<p>The voice from the speaking tube rolled into
the pilot house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Steam&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the echo of the words the steady beat of the
engines slowed and it was only by clinging to the
wheel with all of his strength that Tom held the
<i>Queen</i> in to shore.</p>
<p>The bow was almost even with the water now.
They seemed to be plowing their way into the
depths of the lake. Then the bow lifted and grated
on the sand. The momentum carried the <i>Queen</i>
forward, shivering and protesting at every foot
it was driven into the beach.</p>
<p>There was a wild scramble on the main deck,
cries of relief and happiness as passengers by the
score jumped into the knee deep water and ran for
shore. The men, women and children on the upper
deck hurried down the stairs while through it all
the band kept up its steady blare, the crash of brass
on brass and the constant thump, thump of the
bass drum.</p>
<p>The danger past, Tom stepped back from the
wheel. His arms felt as though they had been
almost pulled from their sockets, so great
had been the strain of holding the <i>Queen</i> on its
course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Helen and Margaret stripped off their life preservers
and went down to the main deck with Tom.
There they found Captain Billy and the crew of
the <i>Queen</i> gathered at the bow of the boat. A
great hole had been torn in the old steamer&rsquo;s hull
by the speed boat and Tom marveled that they had
been able to make shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we sink out in the lake?&rdquo; he asked
Captain Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we might have,&rdquo; smiled the captain,
&ldquo;but we managed to hold the speed boat in the
hole it had made until we were most to shore.
Otherwise we&rsquo;d have filled and gone down inside
a couple of minutes after they hit us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A decidedly sheepish young man broke through
the group and faced Captain Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the owner of the boat that hit you,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;We were going to see how close we
could come and one of the girls in the boat tickled
me and I swung the wheel the wrong way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You almost swung about four hundred people
into the lake,&rdquo; Captain Billy reminded him tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry,&rdquo; replied the owner of the
speed boat, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m decidedly grateful to you for
fishing us out of it after we hit you. I&rsquo;m Maxfield
Hooker of Cranston and I&rsquo;ll be glad to pay for
all of the damage to your boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that later,&rdquo; said Captain Billy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to see that those excursionists all make
their trains.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get that?&rdquo; said Tom as he nudged
Helen. &ldquo;Maxfield Hooker of Cranston, son of the
multi-millionaire soap manufacturer. Captain
Billy can have a new <i>Queen</i> if he wants one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My guess is that he won&rsquo;t want one,&rdquo; said
Helen. &ldquo;After all, the <i>Queen</i> has had a long and
useful career and she certainly proved herself in
the emergency tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Billy made sure that all of the excursionists
were safely off the boat and that done, he
came back to where Tom, Helen and Margaret
were standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great deal to be thankful for,&rdquo; he told
them. &ldquo;It was only through the nerve and calmness
of the crew and such as you three that the
<i>Queen</i> pulled through. Tom, I&rsquo;m eternally grateful
to you for sticking in the pilot house and to
you girls for having the presence of mind to pass
out the life preservers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they could reply Captain Billy turned
and hastened up to the pilot house. Tom started
to follow but Helen stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He wants to say good-bye
to the <i>Queen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br /><i>Success Attends</i></h2>
<p>Later that night the <i>Queen</i> caught fire and
burned to the water&rsquo;s edge. Some said that Captain
Billy, saddened by the tragedy which had almost
befallen the majestic old craft, had set the
fire himself but none ever knew definitely.</p>
<p>Helen telephoned the story of Captain Billy and
the burning of the <i>Queen</i> to the <i>Associated Press</i>
at Cranston and found the night editor there
anxious for the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great human interest stuff,&rdquo; he said as he
hung up.</p>
<p>The Blairs and Stevens watched the burning
of the <i>Queen</i> from the knoll on which the Blair
home was situated and later they saw the shower
of fireworks set off at Crescent Beach, far down
the lake. It was well after midnight when they
finally called it a day, one which would long be
remembered by Tom and Helen Blair and Margaret
Stevens.</p>
<p>The second day of the celebration, Sunday, they
rested quietly at home and planned for the coming
week.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>With the Monday morning mail came the papers
from Cranston, a letter from McClintock of the
<i>Associated Press</i> and new thrills for Helen.</p>
<p>The Cranston papers blazoned her story of
&ldquo;Speed&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s plans to circle the globe in a nonstop
refueling flight on the front page and the big
surprise was the first line which read: &ldquo;By Helen
Blair, Special Correspondent of the Associated
Press, Copyright 1932 (All Rights Reserved).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen gazed at the story in frank awe and
amazement. She knew it was a highly important
story, but to get a by-line with the Associated
Press was an honor she scarcely had dared dream
about.</p>
<p>The letter from McClintock commended her
further for her work, promised that her monthly
check would be a liberal one and added that when
she finished high school he would be glad to consider
her for a job with the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Helen sat down and wrote a long letter to her
father, telling in detail the events of the Fourth
and enclosing the Associated Press story and her
letter from McClintock. That done, she turned
to the task of writing her stories for the <i>Weekly
Herald</i>. Tom was out soliciting ads, Margaret
had gone down the lake to check up at both summer
resorts about possible accidents and she had
the office to herself that morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Which story should Helen write first, &ldquo;Speed&rdquo;
Rand&rsquo;s world flight, the celebration at Sandy Point
or the story of Captain Billy and the <i>Queen</i>? She
threaded a sheet of copy paper into her typewriter
and sought inspiration in a blank gaze at the ceiling.
Inspiration failed to come from that source
and she scrawled aimlessly with pencil and paper,
her mind mulling over the myriad facts of her
stories. Then she started typing. Her first story
concerned Captain Billy and the <i>Queen</i>, for Captain
Billy and his ancient craft were known to
every reader of the <i>Herald</i>. They were home
news. &ldquo;Speed&rdquo; Rand and his plans concerned the
outside world.</p>
<p>The events of the night of the Fourth were
indelibly printed in Helen&rsquo;s mind and the copy
rolled from her typewriter, two, four, six, ten
pages. She stopped long enough to delve into the
files and find the story which the <i>Herald</i> had
printed 23 years before when the <i>Queen</i> made
her maiden trip on Lake Dubar. Two more
pages of copy rolled from her machine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Helen picked up the typed pages, 12 altogether.
She hadn&rsquo;t intended to make the story that long
but it had written itself, it was one of those stories
in which danger and heroism combine to make the
human-interest that all newspaper readers enjoy.</p>
<p>With the story of Captain Billy and the <i>Queen</i>
out of the way, Helen wrote a short lead about
&ldquo;Speed&rdquo; Rand and then clipped the rest of the
story for the <i>Herald</i> from the one she had telephoned
the Associated Press. Even then it would
run more than a column and with a long story
on the general Fourth of July celebration she felt
that the <i>Herald</i> would indeed give its subscribers
their money&rsquo;s worth of news that week.</p>
<p>There was a slight let-down in advertising the
week following the Fourth but they crammed the
six home-printed pages of the <i>Herald</i> full of news
and went to press early Thursday, for it was election
day and the fate of the paved road program
was at stake. For the last month Helen had written
editorials urging the improvement of the roads
and they went directly from the office Thursday
afternoon to the polling place to remain there
until the last ballot had been counted. The vote
was heavy and Rolfe favored the good roads 452
to 73.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Doctor Stevens, who announced the vote to the
anxious crowd, added, &ldquo;And I think we can thank
Helen Blair, our young editor of the <i>Herald</i>, for
showing us the value of better roads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was hearty applause and calls for speech,
but Helen refused to talk, hurrying away to telephone
the Rolfe vote to the Associated Press. The
morning papers announced that the program had
carried in the state as a whole and that paving
would start at once with Rolfe assured of being
on the scenic highway not later than the next
summer.</p>
<p>News from their father in Arizona continued
cheering and as their own bank account increased
steadily and circulation mounted, Tom and Helen
felt that they were making a success of their
management of the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<p>The remainder of July passed rapidly and the
hot blasts of August winds seared the valley of
Lake Dubar. The only refreshing thing was the
night breeze from the lake which cooled the
heat-baked town and afforded some relief. Then came
the cooler days of September and the return to
school.</p>
<p>Superintendent Fowler arrived a week before
the opening of the fall term and Tom and Helen
arranged to attend part time, yet carry full work.
Helen also worked out plans for a school page,
news of every grade to be written by some student
especially designated as a reporter for the &ldquo;<i>School
Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Tom and Helen had so systematized their work
that the task of getting out the paper was reduced
to a minimum. With Margaret willing to help
whenever needed, they felt sure they could continue
the successful operation of the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<p>Every spare hour Helen devoted to building
up the circulation list and by early October they
had added 400 new subscribers, which gave the
<i>Herald</i> a total of 1,272 in the county and every
one paid up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, I never thought we could get that many,&rdquo;
said Tom as he checked over the circulation
records. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be named one of the
official county papers. What a surprise that will
be for Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said we&rsquo;d have a lot of trouble
with Burr Atwell, editor of the <i>Advocate</i> at
Auburn,&rdquo; chided Helen as she recalled her
brother&rsquo;s dire statements of what the fiery editor
of the Auburn paper would do when he found the
<i>Herald</i> was trying to take the county printing
away from him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just been lucky so far,&rdquo; replied Tom.
&ldquo;Atwell will wake up one of these days and then
we&rsquo;ll have plenty of trouble. He won&rsquo;t fight fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not borrow trouble until it arrives,&rdquo;
Helen smiled.</p>
<p>Organization of the high school classes and
election of officers followed the opening of school
and Helen found herself president of the juniors
while Tom was named secretary and treasurer of
the seniors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty proud of both of you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Blair when they told her the news that night at
dinner. &ldquo;It is no more than you deserve but I
hope it won&rsquo;t be too much of a burden added to
your work on the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take much time,&rdquo; Tom assured her,
&ldquo;and since Marg Stevens is vice president of the
juniors Helen can turn a lot of the work over
to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were still at the dinner table when a heavy
knock at the front door startled them. Tom
answered the summons and they heard him talking
with someone with an exceedingly harsh voice.
When Tom returned he was accompanied by a
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is Mr. Atwell, editor
of the <i>Auburn Advocate</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Mrs. Blair acknowledged the introduction and
Tom introduced the visiting editor to Helen. Mr.
Atwell sat down heavily in a chair Tom offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know why I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Blair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the <i>Herald</i> and the circulation tactics
of these young whipper-snappers of yours. I
hear they&rsquo;re trying to take the county printing
away from me and become one of the official
papers of the county.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who informed you of that?&rdquo; asked Helen, who
had taken an instant dislike to the pudgy visitor
whose flabby cheeks were covered with a heavy
stubble of whiskers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folks have been talking,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you want information like that you&rsquo;d
better come to those concerned,&rdquo; retorted the energetic
young editor of the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m a-doing,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we what?&rdquo; interposed Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to be a county paper?&rdquo; snorted
Atwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;we are. This section of
the county doesn&rsquo;t have an official weekly and the
people here want one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to rob me of my bread and butter
for your own selfish ends,&rdquo; stormed the visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not trying to rob anybody,&rdquo; replied
Tom. &ldquo;Get this straight. We&rsquo;ve as much if not
more right to be a county weekly than you have.
All we have to say is be sure your records are
correct when the supervisors meet in December.
Now get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Atwell rose slowly, his heavy features suffused
with anger and his hands shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I serve notice on you,&rdquo; he stormed, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ll
never win out.&rdquo; He stomped from the room,
slamming the front door as he went.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair looked at Tom and Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you were a little short with
him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; admitted Helen, &ldquo;but he can&rsquo;t tell
us what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that,&rdquo; smiled her mother, &ldquo;you take after
your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They refused to let the warning from the editor
of the Auburn paper dim their hopes or retard
their efforts. Circulation mounted steadily until
by mid-November it had reached an even 1,400.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Tom continued his weekly trips to Gladbrook
to get the county farm news and to solicit advertising.
From one of these trips he returned
jubilant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking with the supervisors,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and they&rsquo;re all in favor of naming the <i>Herald</i> the
third official paper instead of the <i>Advocate</i>. One
of them suggested that we get an auditor from
Cranston to go over our circulation list and officially
audit it and then have him with us when
we appear before the board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t that cost a lot of money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably $50 but having an audited list will
practically insure us of getting the county work.
Also, I&rsquo;m going to take our subscription records
and list over to the bank and keep them there until
we need them every Thursday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard some talk in the courthouse that Atwell
had been boasting he&rsquo;d get even with us and I&rsquo;m
not going to take any chances with the records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With characteristic determination Tom made
the transfer that afternoon and it was only mid-evening
of the same day when the fire siren
sounded its alarm.</p>
<p>All of the Blairs hurried outside where, from
the front porch of their home, they could look
down main street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The truck is stopping in front of the <i>Herald</i>
office!&rdquo; gasped Helen.</p>
<p>Without a word Tom plunged down the hill,
running full speed for the office. Helen and her
mother followed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Main street rapidly filled with excited townspeople
and they caught the odor of burning wood
as they neared the <i>Herald</i> building. Margaret
Stevens ran up to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look bad,&rdquo; she tried to reassure them,
&ldquo;and the firemen have it under control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen was so weak from the shock of the fire
that she clung to Margaret and her mother for
support. Her head reeled as picture thoughts
raced through her mind. The threats of Burr
Atwell, all of their months of hard work, the expense
of the fire, their father&rsquo;s need for money,
Tom&rsquo;s precautions in moving the circulation list.</p>
<p>Then it was over. The firemen dragged their
line of hose from the chemical tank back to the
street and they crowded into the smoke-filled
rooms. The fire had started near the back door
but thanks to the night watchman had been detected
before it had gained headway. The week&rsquo;s
supply of print paper was ruined and the two
rooms blackened by smoke and splattered with the
chemical used to check the flames, but the press
and Linotype were undamaged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>Tom wanted to stay and clean up the office but
Mrs. Blair insisted that they all return home, herself
instructing the night watchman to hire several
town laborers to work the rest of the night cleaning
up the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fire was deliberately set,&rdquo; raged Tom as
they walked home. &ldquo;The fire chief saved the
greasy rags he found in the corner of the composing
room where it started. Ten more minutes
without discovery and we wouldn&rsquo;t have had a
newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could have done such a thing?&rdquo; protested
his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burr Atwell,&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;The editorial
office had been ransacked for the circulation
records. It&rsquo;s a good thing I moved them this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we prove Atwell had a hand in this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose so,&rdquo; admitted Tom, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll
run a story in this week&rsquo;s issue that will scare
him. We&rsquo;ll say the fire chief is investigating and
may ask for state secret service men to help him
run down the fire bug who started it. That ought
to give Atwell a queer feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>They telephoned for another supply of print
paper for the week&rsquo;s issue and the next morning
were back at the office. The men who had worked
through the night had done a good job of cleaning
and there was little evidence of fire other than
the charred casings of the back door and smudgy
condition of the walls and ceiling.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving was brightened by word from
their father that he would be able to return home
in the spring but despite that it was a sad day in
the Blair home for there was none to fill his chair
at the head of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas,&rdquo; thought Helen, &ldquo;is going to be
terribly lonesome for mother with Dad so far
away,&rdquo; and the more she thought about it the
more determined she became. Without saying
anything to Tom or her mother, she made several
guarded inquiries at the station and elicited the
desired information.</p>
<p>The days before the annual meeting of the
supervisors passed rapidly. The ground whitened
under the first snow of the year and the auditor
for whom Tom had arranged in Cranston arrived
to audit their circulation list officially. For a week
before his arrival Tom and Helen concentrated
every effort on their circulation with the result
that when the audit was completed the <i>Herald</i>
could boast of 1,411 paid up subscriptions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a remarkably fine piece of work,&rdquo;
Curtis Adams, the auditor, told Helen, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
sure you young folks deserve the county work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The supervisors met on Thursday, December
15th, and in order to attend the meeting Tom and
Helen worked most of Wednesday night getting
the final pages of the <i>Herald</i> on the press, assembling
and folding the papers. It was three o&rsquo;clock
in the morning when they reached home and their
mother, who had been sleeping on a davenport
awaiting their return, prepared a hot lunch and
then sent them to bed.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock Tom teased their venerable
flivver into motion and with their records and the
auditor in the back seat, they started for Gladbrook.
It was well after ten o&rsquo;clock when they
reached the courthouse and they went directly to
the supervisors&rsquo; rooms where a clerk asked them
to wait.</p>
<p>Half an hour later they were called and Helen
went into the board room with mixed emotions
throbbing through her mind. What would be the
answer to their months of work? Would they
get the county work which meant so much or
would Burr Atwell succeed in defeating them?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Her arms ached from the heavy task of folding
the papers the night before and she was so
nervous she was on the verge of tears. If they
won they would be able to buy a folder for the
press and she wouldn&rsquo;t have to fold any more
papers. That thought alone gave her new courage
and she smiled bravely at Tom as he stepped forward
and told the supervisors why he believed the
<i>Herald</i> should be the third county paper.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Adams, the auditor, presented his
sworn statement of the circulation of the <i>Herald</i>
and in conclusion, he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never seen a sounder or better circulation
than these young people have built up. They
have made no special offers nor have they reduced
rates. People who take the <i>Herald</i> do so because
it is one of the best weekly papers I have ever
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chairman of the board of supervisors
looked expectantly around the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gladbrook papers, the <i>News</i> and the
<i>Times</i>, have made their application and the <i>Herald</i>
has just been heard,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I expected
Mr. Atwell of the <i>Auburn Advocate</i> would be
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>The board waited for fifteen minutes. Then
there was a whispered conference between members
and the chairman stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The selection of official papers has been made,&rdquo;
he announced. &ldquo;<i>The Gladbrook News</i>, the <i>Gladbrook
Times</i> and the <i>Rolfe Herald</i> will be known
as the official papers for the ensuing year. The
meeting is adjourned until afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editors of the Gladbrook papers offered
Tom and Helen their congratulations and expressed
willingness to cooperate in every way.</p>
<p>When they were alone Tom looked at Helen
through eyes that were dim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won,&rdquo; he said huskily, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s all due to
your hard work on circulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s eyes were just as misty as she smiled
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;it was your hunch in putting
the records in the bank. We&rsquo;d have been
ruined if you hadn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m wondering why Mr.
Atwell didn&rsquo;t appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a hunch he was afraid we had connected
him with the fire,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s phone
mother and then send a wire to Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>That afternoon Tom completed the arrangements
to publish the official proceedings of the
county supervisors and increased the amount of
job printing he was to get from the courthouse.
He also hired a middle-aged printer who agreed
to come to Rolfe and work for $18 a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t that a little extravagant?&rdquo; asked
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have help now,&rdquo; explained Tom, &ldquo;and
with the county printing safely tucked away we
can afford it. Also, I bought a second-hand folder
from the <i>Times</i> here. It only cost me $50 and
you&rsquo;ll never have to fold papers again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so happy,&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, &ldquo;for I
did hate to fold them. There were so many along
toward the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way home that afternoon they made
further plans and checked up on their funds in
the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a little over $900 right now,&rdquo; said
Tom, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s deducting all of my extravagances
of an auditor and buying the second-hand
folder. Our bills are all paid and we&rsquo;re having a
record December in advertising. I&rsquo;d say we were
sitting pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking about Christmas,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be mighty lonesome without Dad,&rdquo;
admitted Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mother will miss him especially. They&rsquo;ve
never been away from each other at the holidays
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in Helen&rsquo;s voice caught Tom&rsquo;s attention
and he glanced at her sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what the dickens are you driving at?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a check for $200 and I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo;
replied Helen. &ldquo;It will mean the happiest Christmas
we&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it and no questions asked until you&rsquo;re
ready to tell me,&rdquo; agreed Tom and when they
reached Rolfe he went to the office and signed a
check for $200 payable to Helen Blair.</p>
<p>The following Thursday fell on the 22nd of
December and there was so much advertising they
had to run two sections of the <i>Herald</i>. The printer
they had hired in Gladbrook was slow but
thorough and they got the paper to press on time.
With the folder installed, Helen was spared the
arduous duties of folding all of the papers and
she devoted her time to running the mailing machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spent that $200 yet?&rdquo; asked Tom as they
walked home through the brisk December evening,
snow crunching underfoot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All gone,&rdquo; smiled Helen, &ldquo;and the big surprise
is here in my pocket. Wait until we get
home and I tell mother about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; grinned Tom.</p>
<p>They found their mother in the kitchen busy
with the evening meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, we&rsquo;ve got a Christmas surprise for
you,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Come in the living room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s thoughtful of you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I
hope you didn&rsquo;t spend too much money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wiping her hands on her apron, she preceded
them into the living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over there on the library table,&rdquo; replied Helen,
pointing to an envelope tied with a band of red
ribbon with a sprig of holly on top.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair picked up the envelope, untied the
ribbon and looked inside. She pulled out two
objects. One was a long, green strip of paper
with many perforations and much printing. The
other was a small black book similar to a check
book.</p>
<p>She held the long slip with hands that trembled
as she read it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a round trip ticket to Rubio, Arizona!&rdquo;
she gasped, &ldquo;Oh, Helen! Tom! How kind of
you. Father and I will have Christmas together!
And here&rsquo;s a book of traveler&rsquo;s checks and Pullman
reservations. I&rsquo;m to leave tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom gave Helen a hearty hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where the $200 went,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair sat down in her favorite chair, the
ticket and check book in her hands, her eyes dim
with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t go away and leave you two here
alone during holidays,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes you can, Mother,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
be happy just knowing that you and Dad are together
and you can tell him all about us and then,
when you come back, you can tell us all about
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go, Mother,&rdquo; insisted Helen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
let Dad in on the surprise and we can&rsquo;t disappoint
him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Stevens drove them to the junction
where Mrs. Blair was to board the Southwestern
limited. Snow was falling steadily, one of those
dry, sifting snows that presage a white Christmas
in the middle west.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>The limited poked its dark nose through the
storm and drew its string of Pullmans up to the
bleak platform. It paused for only a minute and
the goodbyes were hasty.</p>
<p>The limited whirled away into the storm and
Tom and Helen, standing alone on the platform,
watched it disappear in the snow. It would be a
quiet Christmas for them but they were supremely
happy knowing that their father was on the road
to health and that they had made a success of the
<i>Herald</i>.</p>
